32,Business,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign upright here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Gen Z is in the financial trenches. A new study from credit reporting agency TransUnion found those in their early 20s are earning less, have more debt and see higher delinquency rates than Millennials did at their age. The findings outline the credit usage of 22 to 24 year old Gen Zers. Millennials who fell in that age range in 2013 were asked about their credit usage during that period. Gen Zers are defined as those born between 1995 and 2012, and Millennials as those born between 1980 and 1994. Gen Zers, like Millennials, have had to deal with economic calamities early in their careers. For Gen Z, it was the Covid-19 pandemic. For Millennials, it was the global financial crisis. But the current generation of early 20-somethings have another challenge: sticky inflation that’s driven up prices of everything from gas at the pump to food at the grocery store. Interest rates perched at a 23-year high have also hiked borrowing rates for auto loans, student loans and mortgages. This isn’t a problem completely unique to early-career consumers. The entire US credit economy has seen higher debt levels and delinquencies across most credit products. A separate TransUnion report found that Americans’ total credit card balance topped $1 trillion for the first time in 2023. But because Gen Zers are early in their credit journeys, it is important for them to establish healthy habits now that will help them down the road, experts say. Before the Bell spoke with Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion, to discuss Gen Zers’ financial situation and what they can do to improve it. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Why are we seeing that Gen Z is tapping into their credit more than their Millennial counterparts 10 years ago? If you think about prices and the cost of living, a lot of what we’ve seen elevated are the things that Gen Z are most likely going to be spending a good portion of their income on. Rent being a huge piece, and we’ve seen double digit increases in rents over the last several years. But even things like food, dining out, gas prices, prices for automobiles and transportation. All of those have seen significant increases. Most Gen Z consumers are not homeowners. They’re renters or living with family or friends. But in those cases where they’re renters, they’re seeing that additional bite that certainly those homeowners that have their homes prior to 2022 haven’t faced. You own your home, your mortgage typically doesn’t vary, but your rent does. And so I think that’s been a big cause of what’s been driving a lot of that financial strain that Gen Z consumers have seen. Do you have any advice for Gen Zers who may find themselves in a difficult financial situation? One of those things that consumers need to realize is, yes, not everybody has the means to pay off their credit cards in full every month. But the cycle of continuing to spend on your credit cards and just paying off the minimums will create opportunities for you to continue to accumulate debt. And it’s going to take a very long time to pay off your credit card balances just paying the minimums every month, particularly if you continue to use those cards. So, understanding what you can afford, what you can spend on (is important). In some cases, consumers have very high debt levels. The opportunity to refinance credit card debt with a less expensive form of debt. Personal loans are a good option for that. You’re forced to make a material payment every month, and consumers can consolidate their credit card debt onto a cheaper form. Over a course of a couple of years, they can pay that off. The key is to not use the personal loans to pay off credit card debt and then run your credit card bills right back up after you do that. Is it fair to say that there is cause for concern when it comes to Gen Z’s financial health, but the situation is more of a wait-and-see than a crisis? I think that’s a very correct assessment. Again, we’ve seen that average credit card balances per consumer, are, even inflation adjusted, 26% higher than they were for Millennials a decade ago. So this is a consumer that has increasingly turned to debt. But even with the higher delinquency levels that we’re seeing, we don’t think that this is necessarily a cause for alarm. Certainly with Gen Z consumers, they are potentially at a stage in their careers where they may see fairly material and rapid salary increases as they go from that first job, either get promoted or take on (other) roles within their organizations or look for new jobs where they have increased earnings opportunities. But at the same time … make sure that again, you’re borrowing and spending within your means. The United Kingdom has come out of a short and shallow recession, giving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak a sorely needed boost ahead of an election expected later this year, report my colleagues Hanna Ziady and Anna Cooban. Gross domestic product grew 0.6% in the first three months of the year compared with the previous quarter, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed Friday. The increase follows falls of 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 0.1% in the third quarter of last year. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. The expansion early this year was driven by “widespread growth” in the dominant service sector, where output ticked up 0.7% during the quarter after dipping late last year, the ONS said. According to projections published Thursday, the Bank of England now expects UK GDP to grow 0.5% this year, double the pace it forecast in February. By comparison, last year, GDP increased by a measly 0.1%. There are other signs the economy’s prospects are brightening. In April, combined output in manufacturing and services recorded the strongest rise in almost a year, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global. Again, service firms drove the expansion. However, compared with its peers, the UK economy is faring less well. Read more here.

33,Business,"Wedding dress shopping may never go back to what it used to be. Instead of collecting your entire bridal entourage to spend a few hours at a boutique trying on several dresses for the perfect find at a lofty price of a $1,000 or more, some retailers are offering to make the wedding dress hunt as easy breezy as buying a T-shirt off the rack. Taking their cue from Millennials and Gen Zers who are turning stuffy traditions on their head and marking life’s milestones moments — such as weddings — intheir own pared down way, a string of affordable fashion brands have jumped into the weddings industry to appease thrifty shoppers with inexpensive bridal wear. Abercrombie, Forever 21, Boot Barn, Shein and Lulus, better known for their tank tops, shorts, ripped jeans, bikinis, cowboy boots and sparkly dresses tailor-made for Beyoncé and Taylor Swift concertgoers, are trying to dress brides for much less. Related articleGen Z is getting married. Together with Millennials, they’re putting their own spin on weddings The move isn’t a complete headscratcher. For one, it allows these mass-market brands to get their slice of the more than $100 billion US wedding industry, according to The Knot Worldwide, a wedding planning and vendor marketplace. “These companies see bridal as a natural extension of their Business given that they are already present in many of these product categories,” said Janine Stichter, managing director and consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst with global financial services and market research firm BTIG. Plus, many of their core customers are older GenZers and younger Millennials who are in the sweet spot age demographic for getting married and attending weddings, she said. “The move into wedding wear makes senseso long as it’s not a distraction from their core Business,” Stichter said. Teen favorite label Abercrombie & Fitch — which has undergone amajor metamorphosisby shedding its overtly sexualized marketing strategy of the past to more on-trend, age-appropriate and parent-approved clothing — is continuingits evolution, by going after brides. The retailer in March launched the A&F Wedding Shop, a collection of more than 100 pieces for brides, the bridal party and wedding guests, all priced from $80 to $150. Beyond dresses, the collection includes items such as bikinis, pajamas and skirts for other events tied to the wedding. “Our customers live for the long weekend, and when we asked them about their exciting upcoming getaways, we heard so many of them speak about wedding weekends, wedding-adjacent occasions, and the all-important question of what to wear, which this collection is perfectly designed to answer,” Carey Collins Krug, chief marketing officer of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., said in a statement announcing the launch. In April, fast-fashion brand Forever 21 debuted itsfirst bridal collection, priced from $9 to about $50. The clothing includes dresses, sleepwear, accessories, such as a wedding-ready cowboy hat with a veil affixed to it. A white strapless satin and lace midi dress from its bridal shop has a pricetag of $24.29, while another altar-ready white split-hem halter midi dress will set a bride back only $27. That’s a basement bargain compared to the average  wedding dress cost last year of$2,000. California-based trendy fashion chain Lulus has also got in on the act by opening its first bridal boutique, with dresses ranging from $100 to $270, in Los Angeles in February. “At Lulus, brides won’t have to compromise. Attaining that luxurious look without breaking their budgets isn’t a dream, it’s a reality,” Crystal Landsem, Lulus CEO, said in a statement in February. The standalone bridal boutique builds on Lulus’ 2019 entry into wedding wear and “enables the brand to offer its customer-first online experience to brides in real life,” the retailer said in a press release. That’s a smart move, said Allyson Rees, a senior insight strategist at trend forecasting and analytics firm WGSN, in an interview with CNN. “For these bridal collections to land with Gen Z, It’s important that these brands tap into the way that Gen Z shops. Gen Z is always online, but 97% of US Gen Z still shop in-store,” Rees said. “Wedding dresses, in particular, and the tradition of trying them on, is a rite of passage that Gen Z still want to partake in. So brands will need to create compelling in-store experiences that encourage socializing.” As the oldest GenZers reach marrying age in their mid-20s, they’re increasingly putting their own spin on nuptials and areletting go of some antiquated traditions. Part of this is also being driven by these younger non-conforming consumers being forced into even more cost sensitivity than Millennials. “The cost-of-living crisis has affected Gen Z, and they feel deeply insecure about their finances,” said Rees. “Over half are living paycheck to paycheck and a third are living with their parents. So it’s no surprise that fast fashion, which has seen its market share increase over the last few years due to the cost-of-living crisis, is capitalizing on the need for affordable, on-trend wedding fashion.” Related articleBrides are pumped to wear black wedding dresses At the same time, wedding fashion is a lot less traditional now, she said. With wedding dresses in particular, one trend that emerged during the pandemic was the popularity ofblack wedding gowns. “Gen Z is very much picking up where Millennials left off here. So it’s not uncommon for brides to wear alternative colors to white, or to change outfits several times during the course of the event. So this an area where fast fashion brands can really fill a void,” Rees said. Shein, which launched in 2012 and has since ballooned into theworld’s biggest online-only fast-fashion seller, also sells bridal and wedding wear. Its bridal gowns cost on average between $50 and $100, up to a maximum of $200. On Memorial Day weekend, the retailer will open a wedding-related pop-up shop in Las Vegas to showcase its new bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses. “Affordable prices are important for Gen Z customers, who often balance the desire for fashionable and trendy styles with a need for options that won’t break the bank,” Lisa Zlotnick, spokesperson for Shein, said in an interview with CNN. “As wedding attire evolves from traditional, occasion-specific outfits to versatile, stylish pieces that can be worn on multiple occasions, we aim to ensure our offerings meet this increasing demand.” Even Boot Barn, which sells cowboy boots and westernwear, has jumped on the wedding bandwagon for the first time, with its new western-themed wedding collection of bridal dresses, cowboy boots, hats and accessories priced mostly at $400 and below. “There’s been a surge in country weddings and casual garden weddings coming out of the pandemic as people wanted to get married outdoors. These are also budget-friendly choices,” said Isha Nicole, senior vice president of marketing with Boot Barn, inan interview. “Couples are trying to move away from something that is formal and stuffy to weddings that embrace a different setting. We looked at these trends and it seemed like a right time to support our customer,” Nicole said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/Business/fast-fashion-wedding-dresses/index.html,CNN,"From the boardwalk to the altar: T-shirt, shorts, bikinis and boot sellers are now dressing brides",,3
34,Business,"If you took an American Airlines flight in the 1960s, you’d be wined and dined from the Coach-class“Royal Coachman” menu. Your meal began with the beef consommé and proceeded to sautéed breast of chicken in wine. Care for a fruit tartlet for dessert? Today, if you’re flying coach, you’ll need to book a long-distance international flight or – maybe if you’re lucky – a coast-to-coast domestic one to receive a free meal. On shorter flights, you might get a choice of complementary Biscoff cookies or pretzels. Airplane food has fallen a long way from the glory days of in-flight dining when meals were served on white tableclothsand stewardesses scrambled eggs in the air. Disappearing meals have joined a long list of pain points, inconveniences and cutbacks that fliers endure today. But industry cost-cutting isn’t the only reason your tartlet is gone. The end of in-flight dining for many passengers surprisingly rose out of big changes in government regulation, airplane design, in-flight movies, industry tax breaks, plus heightened health and safety concerns. Airline safety protocols and regulations since September 11 have changed what types of cooking knives crews can work with in the air.Airplane galleys are smaller to allow for more passenger seats on a plane. And airlines don’t serve some foods, like peanuts, to protect people with allergies. Meals are often smaller, blander or non-existent. “Meal service was once a point of pride,” said Henry Harteveldt, who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group. Now, “the quality is so poor you have to wonder: Do airline executives actually have taste buds?” Airlines have long looked for ways to cut food production costs and reduce meal preparation times for flight attendants on board. In one famous example during the 1980s, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, bragged about how removing justone olive from every saladsaved the airline $40,000 a year. Cost and speed became more important to airlines than how the food tastes ever since. Carriers like Singapore Airlines or Delta mayhave partnerships with Michelin-starred celebrity chefs,but most companies farm out their food to catering services who may prepare it hours ahead. “People are willing to trade food for low fares,” said Blaise Waguespack, a professor of airline marketing at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. “Your ticket gets you the seat. And anything beyond the seat you pay for.” Charging passengers for food on board – even just a few dollars for a sandwich, snack box or cheese plate - is also a way for airlines to save on taxes. Domestic airfares are subject to a 7.5% federal excise tax, but that tax doesn’t apply tobaggage feesand on-board food, both of which are getting more expensive. Food on planes has been around almost a century, ever since 1920s flight attendants handed out chewing gum to passengers to relieve pressure in their ears. Early airplanes bounced so much in flight that meals were served on paper plates, according to theSmithsonian. For decades, the federal government regulated airfare and routes, so airlines tried to set themselves apart with service, food and the kind of luxury usually afforded cruise passengers – or a Bond villain. Until 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the law required that every passenger got an entrée, two vegetables, a salad, dessert and a drink as part of their ticket price, according to the Smithsonian. “Delicious food adds to the enjoyment. It’s prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, where dishes can be cooked in five-minute ovens,” Pan Am advertised in a 1958commercial. During the 1960s and 1970s, airlines routinely installed sky-high kitchens on board and advertised their menus to draw customers. Beef was a Business strategy. ”Airlines competed on service and amenities. Meal service was a big focus of [competition] because Entertainment options were more limited,” Harteveldt said. “Airlines would have teams of chefs, their own catering kitchens [and] advertising around food.” As deregulation took hold, airlines cut ticket prices. But to make up for lost revenue, they cut back onfood choices and other servicesas well. The September 11 attacks accelerated the decline of free airline meals. Airlines faced a deep reduction in demand and slashed in-flight meal service in response. United, American Airlines, Delta and others announcedsharp reductions in-flight meal serviceshortly after the attacks. The last holdout, Continental Airlines, became the final major airline to end free domestic meals in economy class in 2010. Airline meals had been the brunt of jokes and criticism for decades, but now people miss them. Few airline-industry experts see them coming back anytime soon in coach. The reality is very different for Business and first-class passengers. Molly Brandt, the executive chef of culinary innovation for North America at in-flight catering company Gategroup, said that the “golden age for airline food is here.” It just depends on which airline you’re flying and category you’re in. “It’s broken down by cabin class,” she explained. If you’re in first class on an American flight, for example, you may have a lunch choice of a Mediterranean bowl, chicken breast with mojo sauce, Poblano black bean rice and plantains or penne pasta with plant-based ragu and ricotta. For Delta, pick between the cheeseburger, the spinach and cheese agnolotti, or a Hempler’s smoked peppered chicken breast salad. A handful of airlines even offer caviar to first class passengers. But most fliers these days don’t even get the free chewing gum.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/Business/airplane-food-travel/index.html,CNN,A brief history of airline food’s rapid descent,,3
35,Entertainment,"Mothers may be the original muse. ThisMother’s Day Weekend, take a look at some of the most emotional movies inspired by moms. There’s bound to be something in here that will make the perfect watch for you and mom (or, you and child). While this film was anOscar darlingthat received heaps of praise, it’s easy to miss the simple fact that behind its fun title and crazy metaverse trappings, “Everything Everywhere” is about amother’s unflinching love for her daughterin crisis. The climactic scene in the parking lot of the family laundromat is impressive for the emotional acrobatics and acts of love that rival any of the spectacle that comes before it. Although this silly movie is mainly a road trip-meets-buddy comedy of sorts – withBarbra Streisandas a hilariously overbearing mom – “Guilt Trip” contains some emotional moments that show a child (Seth Rogen, at his awkward best) reapproaching and reassessing his relationship with his at-times irritating mother as not only a parent, but as a friend and confidante. The last shot utilizes some of the best background acting work that really drives home the universality of moms and motherhood. Also a fixture on most Christmas movie lists, this beloved franchise-spawning movie stems from a simple yet major oversight that is immortalized by Catherine O’Hara’s closeup and incredulous utterance of, “KEVIN!!!” Her character’s love for her son is the driving force of “Home Alone,” and O’Hara even mentioned it late last year when her onscreen son Macaulay Culkinreceived his staron the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This entertaining movie pitsAmerica Ferreraagainst her mom – the late and great Lupe Ontiveros (“Selena”) – when they differ on whether she should go to college or stay home and provide for the family. The film explores generational and cultural gaps in a Mexican-American family to often hilarious and insightful effect. Another look at a family and the intergenerational dynamics between mothers and daughters, this underrated drama stars Jane Fonda as a strict grandmother weathering her unruly granddaughter played by Lindsay Lohan, and daughter (Felicity Huffman) in full-blown crisis mode. Although the film was overshadowed by on-set drama, Lohan in particular knocks it out of the park with a layered performance. When family matriarch Josephine “Big Mama” Joseph (Irma P. Hall) falls into a coma, her daughters – played by Vanessa Williams, Vivica A. Fox and Nia Long – are sent reeling. As they struggle to adjust to the new normal, old sisterly rivalries come up, new bonds are formed, and traditions – specifically, that of Sunday family dinner – are upheld. Julia Roberts has more than held her own on screen as both a mother and a daughter, first with her Oscar-nominated performance in the 1989 tearjerker “Steel Magnolias,” in which she played a diabetic woman who challenges her worried mother’s (Sally Field) advice to not have a child of her own over fears for her health. “I would rather have thirty minutes of wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special” is just one of the memorable quotes from the film. In 1998, Roberts took on the role of the titular “Stepmom” opposite Susan Sarandon in another cry-inducing drama, but it was her turn as overwhelmed legal assistant and mother-of-three in 2000’s “Erin Brockovich” that finally scored her an Academy Award, anddeservedly so. This one’s a doozy. Halle Berry won an Oscar for playing the wife of a death row inmate struggling to make ends meet and provide for her son. The story takes on Book of Job proportions as Berry’s character is faced with ever-mounting tragedy, while an unlikely bond somehow gives her the strength to move forward. This odd and engrossing movie from Wes Anderson reminds us that a mother’s love can come in many forms, and can change, sometimes drastically. The film follows three brothers – played by Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson – as they search for their mother who has defected to India after their father’s death. While they don’t exactly get what they’re looking for when they find her, they each embark on a journey that ultimately helps them grow and evolve. Based on the acclaimed novel by Amy Tan, this sprawling drama follows a posse of Chinese women in San Francisco who meet regularly to play Mahjong. Invariably, tales of history and family collide as the women reflect on their lives and those that came before them – as well as the wellbeing of their daughters – with vignettes and flashbacks that bridge generations and continents. Often referred to as the greatest actress of her generation, some of Meryl Streep’s most searing work comes from her performances as a mother. Her Oscar-winning portrayal of a woman who leaves her husband and young son in 1979’s “Kramer Vs. Kramer” challenged societal expectations at the time. Three years later, Streep again won Oscar gold playing a woman trying to survive the Holocaust in an unspeakably horrific situation with her two children in “Sophie’s Choice.” In 1990, she played daughter to Shirley MacLaine in the hilarious yet heartfelt “Postcards from the Edge,” based on Carrie Fisher’s memoir of being raised by Hollywood star Debbie Reynolds (who starred in another brilliant Mother’s Day movie – Albert Brooks’ “Mother” in 1996). Other standout Streep-as-mom performances include her 1994 turn as a badass whitewater rafting expert in “The River Wild,” and as a dysfunctional mother to Leonardo DiCaprio and sister to Diane Keaton in 1996’s “Marvin’s Room.” (There’s also two films in which she played mothers stricken with cancer – “One True Thing” opposite Renée Zellweger in 1998, and 2013’s “August: Osage County,” which pitted Streep as a vitriolic mother against her daughters, one of whom was played by Julia Roberts.) Speaking of Diane Keaton, “Baby Boom” is an ’80s gem that sees the comedic actress holding her own as a high-powered executive in her “Me Decade” prime, only to be thrown a curveball when a distant relative dies and leaves her a… baby to raise. The fish-out-of-water antics are amusing as handled by Keaton, as she learns to eventually embrace her role as de facto mother while also launching a new baby food line. If you’re a fan of Keaton, another excellent go-to (again, overlapping into Xmas movie territory) is “The Family Stone,” a thoroughly enjoyable 2005 romp with the actress playing the matriarch of a clan dealing with one son’s less-than-desirable choice for a mate (played to irksome effect by Sarah Jessica Parker). Make sure to keep the tissue box nearby though. Hold on to those tissue boxes for this one too. Shirley MacLaine won an Oscar for playing always-about-her Aurora Greenway in what is arguably the mother of all mother-daughter movies, “Terms of Endearment.” The James L. Brooks-directed dramedy follows Aurora’s all-consuming relationship with her daughter Emma, played by an equally impressive Debra Winger, as the pair navigate love and family within their respective lives. When Aurora is confronted with her daughter’s sudden illness, her love and ferocity is on full display, especially in an indelible scene at the hospital when she asks the nurse to “give her the shot!!” Another visceral entry is “Room,” in which Brie Larson turned in an Academy Award-winning performance as an abducted woman who strives to create an entire world for her son in the single room to which they’re permanently bound. The movie oscillates between being a reflective study on the perseverance of the human spirit and a pulse-pounding thriller showing a mother’s desperate attempt to gain freedom for her child. A thrilling sci-fi sequel wouldn’t immediately be the first place you’d think to look for authentic mother-child drama, but James Cameron’s acclaimed entry in this franchise follows Sigourney Weaver’s central heroine Ellen Ripley as she wakes up after an accidentally prolonged bout of hypersleep to discover that her daughter back on earth has died of old age. Lost, Ripley eventually falls in with a platoon dispatched to the planet from1979’s first “Alien” film, where she discovers a lone survivor named Newt (Carrie Henn). Ripley naturally takes Newt under her wing and they soon face off with the Alien Queen, in what becomes the ultimate showdown between two really pissed off mothers.

36,Entertainment,"Mothers may be the original muse. ThisMother’s Day Weekend, take a look at some of the most emotional movies inspired by moms. There’s bound to be something in here that will make the perfect watch for you and mom (or, you and child). While this film was anOscar darlingthat received heaps of praise, it’s easy to miss the simple fact that behind its fun title and crazy metaverse trappings, “Everything Everywhere” is about amother’s unflinching love for her daughterin crisis. The climactic scene in the parking lot of the family laundromat is impressive for the emotional acrobatics and acts of love that rival any of the spectacle that comes before it. Although this silly movie is mainly a road trip-meets-buddy comedy of sorts – withBarbra Streisandas a hilariously overbearing mom – “Guilt Trip” contains some emotional moments that show a child (Seth Rogen, at his awkward best) reapproaching and reassessing his relationship with his at-times irritating mother as not only a parent, but as a friend and confidante. The last shot utilizes some of the best background acting work that really drives home the universality of moms and motherhood. Also a fixture on most Christmas movie lists, this beloved franchise-spawning movie stems from a simple yet major oversight that is immortalized by Catherine O’Hara’s closeup and incredulous utterance of, “KEVIN!!!” Her character’s love for her son is the driving force of “Home Alone,” and O’Hara even mentioned it late last year when her onscreen son Macaulay Culkinreceived his staron the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This entertaining movie pitsAmerica Ferreraagainst her mom – the late and great Lupe Ontiveros (“Selena”) – when they differ on whether she should go to college or stay home and provide for the family. The film explores generational and cultural gaps in a Mexican-American family to often hilarious and insightful effect. Another look at a family and the intergenerational dynamics between mothers and daughters, this underrated drama stars Jane Fonda as a strict grandmother weathering her unruly granddaughter played by Lindsay Lohan, and daughter (Felicity Huffman) in full-blown crisis mode. Although the film was overshadowed by on-set drama, Lohan in particular knocks it out of the park with a layered performance. When family matriarch Josephine “Big Mama” Joseph (Irma P. Hall) falls into a coma, her daughters – played by Vanessa Williams, Vivica A. Fox and Nia Long – are sent reeling. As they struggle to adjust to the new normal, old sisterly rivalries come up, new bonds are formed, and traditions – specifically, that of Sunday family dinner – are upheld. Julia Roberts has more than held her own on screen as both a mother and a daughter, first with her Oscar-nominated performance in the 1989 tearjerker “Steel Magnolias,” in which she played a diabetic woman who challenges her worried mother’s (Sally Field) advice to not have a child of her own over fears for her health. “I would rather have thirty minutes of wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special” is just one of the memorable quotes from the film. In 1998, Roberts took on the role of the titular “Stepmom” opposite Susan Sarandon in another cry-inducing drama, but it was her turn as overwhelmed legal assistant and mother-of-three in 2000’s “Erin Brockovich” that finally scored her an Academy Award, anddeservedly so. This one’s a doozy. Halle Berry won an Oscar for playing the wife of a death row inmate struggling to make ends meet and provide for her son. The story takes on Book of Job proportions as Berry’s character is faced with ever-mounting tragedy, while an unlikely bond somehow gives her the strength to move forward. This odd and engrossing movie from Wes Anderson reminds us that a mother’s love can come in many forms, and can change, sometimes drastically. The film follows three brothers – played by Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson – as they search for their mother who has defected to India after their father’s death. While they don’t exactly get what they’re looking for when they find her, they each embark on a journey that ultimately helps them grow and evolve. Based on the acclaimed novel by Amy Tan, this sprawling drama follows a posse of Chinese women in San Francisco who meet regularly to play Mahjong. Invariably, tales of history and family collide as the women reflect on their lives and those that came before them – as well as the wellbeing of their daughters – with vignettes and flashbacks that bridge generations and continents.

Her sharp quips about the former NFL quarterback gained her thousands of new followers on Instagram and a hilarious appearance on ESPN’s “The Pat McAfee Show.” Glaser, however, is taking it all in stride. She’s been doing standup long enough to know the ups and downs of the Entertainment industry. “I’ve never felt like when are people gonna get it? I’m not one of those people. I always feel like I kind of am getting what I deserve. I’m not someone who’s been waiting for this my whole life,” Glaser told CNN in an interview this week. “I mean, obviously this has been the goal to be beloved on this kind of scale, but it’s also scary because when it comes on fast like this, you know, this kind of enthusiasm for someone lasts for a moment but can go away pretty quickly.” Glaser said she knew Brady’s “Greatest Roast of All Time” would land with viewers. “I knew it was a home run and I knew that the event would be special because it was live,” she said. “I had hoped it would be number one on Netflix and that there would be viral moments, but I didn’t think that I would be a big part of all that discussion.” As the roast got closer, Glaser was ran her Brady jokes in up to four sets a night in Los Angeles, “jumping from club to club.” “Working with a team of writers, we would work during the day and then we would write in between shows and treat it like I was hosting an award show,” she said. “The way I would do it if I got asked to host the Oscars, like it’s that big of a deal. So, I took it really seriously.” Glaser also took her preparations seriously for her new special, “Someday You’ll Die.” In it, she covers substantive topics like having kids, body image and death, but promises fans both old and new will find plenty of laughs, too. “It’s just a look at my life right now as I’m approaching 40 and all my friends are having kids and starting families, getting married. I don’t really have any of that,” she said. “[The special explores] how I suffer with depression, despite the fact that my life is great, my fear of death, my longing for it at times, [with] really hard jokes in between.” Glaser describes her new work as “honest, raw, really tight comedy,” two years in the making. “Someday You’ll Die” debuts May 11 on Max, which like CNN is part of Warner Bros.

39,Entertainment,"Editor’s note:The following contains spoilers about the May 9 episode of “Young Sheldon.” Anyone who watched “The Big Bang Theory” with any regularity over its 12 seasons knew what was coming as its prequel“Young Sheldon”comes to a close, but the knock at the door that ended the most recent episode still felt like a gut punch. As the young Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) prepared to head off to college, he and his family learned that his father (Lance Barber) has died of a heart attack, the aftermath of which will be addressed in the two-part series finale on May 16. The moment seemed particularly cruel, inasmuch as the father, George Sr., had just been offered a long-sought opportunity to move up from coaching high school football into the college ranks, receiving an offer from Rice in Houston. “We always knew that there were a couple big moments that happened in Sheldon’s life, his father passes away and he goes to Caltech,” executive producer Steve Holland told CNN, adding that the decision was made to have that happen now – as opposed to during the final two episodes – so the characters could deal with its aftermath in the finale. According to Holland, series co-creator Chuck Lorre suggested that schedule of events, saying that after seven seasons of comedy (allowing for the occasional poignant moment), “Maybe we don’t want to leave the audience wallowing in grief at the end.” The elder Sheldon (Jim Parsons) had referenced his father’s death, and when it happened, during “The Big Bang Theory,” although with the benefit of hindsight he wasn’t always the most reliable narrator regarding his father and his perceived shortcomings – at least, based on how they played out in the second series. Although “Young Sheldon” is wrapping up, CBS viewers haven’t seen the last of the Coopers: the network has ordered another spinoff, featuring the characters of Georgie (Montana Jordan) and Mandy (Emily Osment) for the 2024-25 TV season – “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage” – which merely adds to the needle-threading act performed by the producers. Still, any concerns about setting up what comes next didn’t play into the “Young Sheldon” ending, Holland said, noting, “We were really just focused on ending this show as strong as we could.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Entertainment/young-sheldon-episode-12-shock/index.html,CNN,No title found,,2

41,Entertainment,"Fifty years ago, two Swedish married couples went on the most consequential double date in music history, changing pop for good at theEurovision Song Contest. True, the bar wasn’t too high. 1974 was also the year that Paul Anka topped charts with “(You’re) Having My Baby,” a track that won a 2006 CNN survey of theworst songs of all time. But Abba – thenstill availablein human form – have remained Eurovision’s de facto godparents as the event grew into the merriest, most colorful musical competition in the world. Now, 50 years on from their “Waterloo” breakout, the contest is back in Sweden, its spiritual home, after Loreen won the country’s seventh crown last May – becoming the first woman to win the competition twice. All these storylines coming together must be fate; incontrovertible proof that God is a Eurovision fan. You couldn’t have written it any better, right Loreen? “People are like ‘OK, Sweden is the spiritual home of Eurovision’ – I see Eurovision as this moving entity,” she tells CNN. “Who cares about the place?” OK, well, that’s not quite the narrative we were going for. But Loreen – who took the sparkly baton from ABBA and is now the undisputed Queen of Eurovision – must feel a tinge of emotion when she sees those four legendary faces on billboards all over host city Malmo… right? “I’m looking at ABBA and I’m like, I want to have those pants,” she exclaims. “Those platform shoes, where can I get those?” Listen, Loreen, can you just say something nice about ABBA, so we can move on from those digitally-rendered dinosaurs and talk about the runners and riders at Eurovision this year? “It really is a work of art, what they’ve created,” Loreen says obligingly, reflecting on the foursome’s musical and stylistic output. “The whole product, ABBA, is a vibe, isn’t it?” That it is. But ABBA are the past; Baby Lasagne, Windows95Man and Nemo – a person, not a fish – are very much the present. And this year’s competition is as moving, ridiculous, naked and powerful as ever. So just in time forPulitzer season, CNN has taken on the earnest task of studiously watching rehearsals and carefully analyzing every song, to bring you this: the definitive guide to the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. Artists have been competing in two semi-finals this week, and 26 made it to Saturday’s grand final, which starts at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. EST) in Malmo. To quote Malta’s vocal gymnast Sarah Bonnici: “Here we go aga…aaa..aaa..aa…ain, huh?” For the rest of Europe, hosting Eurovision is an unimaginable honor. For Sweden, it’s beginning to feel like that “quirky” friend’s improv troupe you’d promised you’d see, then promptly forgot about until the last minute, just as you’re stepping into a bubble bath with a glass of Pinot Grigio. This year’s fan park isa bit budget, complain seasoned eurofans. Public rehearsals were half-full, and tickets remain for the final, with mere hours to go. Some even claim the show’s slogan - “United by Music” - may be influenced by last year’s slogan, “United by Music.” But Eurovision is a special part of the cultural calendar. “This community is the whole palette of what we are. Goofy, serious, nerdy,” Loreen says, counting adjectives on some unnecessarily long, golden fingernails. “Everything that you can imagine.” If there’s one thing the contest has taught her, it’s this: “You can actually feel real, authentic love for people that you don’t know, but youdoknow… you know?” Loreen will be performing as a guest during Saturday’s final, while 22-year-old identical twins Marcus and Martinus take the daunting mantle of competing for the host country. “We’re very competitive people; I think we’re the most competitive in the whole competition,” they say without a trace of irony. This year’s slim favorite is Baby Lasagne, whose arena-pounding anthem “Rim Tim Tagi Dim” describes a brain drain affecting Croatian towns. “Ay, I’m a big boy now; I’m going away and I sold my cow,” he chants. But Mr. Lasagne is nothing if not modest. He credits his fiancée with helping him launch his career – “She’s the lasagne, and I’m just the baby,” he tells CNN. “I don’t even like lasagne that much,” he adds, disappointingly. “I mean, it’s OK. I eat it a few times a year.” He’s juking it out with Switzerland’s Nemo, who came up with genre-bending epic “The Code” at Eurovision camp, a place whose mere mention would induce bewilderment to the non-European mind. “It was like a playground,” Nemo says. But now Nemo’s at the real thing, “and it’s even bigger and crazier than I expected it to be.” Ireland’s Bambie Thug is surging as the final approaches, and the Netherland’s Joost Klein is in with a shot. “I don’t mind winning, and I also don’t mind losing. I love being,” he says. No-one has had a bigger nightmare in Malmo than Windows95Man, whose entire persona revolves around an operating system whose name and logo cannot legally be shown at Eurovision. Teemu Keisteri, the genius behind the act, decided to wear a blurred version of the logo on his T-shirt instead. And he wears little else; Finland’s performance sees Windows95Man hatch from a giant egg, then run around with no trousers on for two minutes, before – spoiler alert – he’s eventually reunited with a pair of denim hot pants that descend from the ceiling. “In my late twenties, I figured out that I don’t need to be normal,” Windows95Man tells CNN. “I cannot control how the world sees my art.” And what is the message of this artwork, exactly? Windows95Man sums it up like this: “If Daddy is a little bit naked, it’s not so serious.” Which is not remotely a creepy thing to say. Europe is utterly obsessed with Eurovision. It’s all they think about year-round. Just ask Greece’s contestant, Marina Satti. “When I grew up I didn’t have a TV, so I kind of lost track,” she says. OK, never mind then. But more than 150 million people do watch every year. Some 129 artists entered San Marino’s national selection – around one Eurovision wannabe for every 260 people living in the microstate. And the contest is as much about the lovable weirdos as it is the winners. CNN’s prestigious, first annual award for the worst Eurovision lyric was hotly contested. We had some spectacular, cliched imagery to consider; Iceland’s Hera Bjork is “standing on the edge of a promise,” Saba is “throwing memories in the air,” and Slimane wants to “create an ocean in the fire.” “Hurricanes are roaming, but you take away the pain,” croons Azerbaijan’sFahree, who’s dressed like he’s come straight from the future – but not a cool part of the future, just a 23rd-century Italian restaurant with a poor hygiene rating. “Shining in a tiger’s eyes, only I can find my future,” Poland’s Luna sings, in a truly nonsensical piece of penmanship that failed to propel her to the final. But Norway’s Gåte take the crown, for this unemotional bit of scene-setting: “I was a very fine and beautiful maiden, with an evil stepmother. My mother had died,” the band explains at the start of their track. “She transformed me into a sword and a needle, and sent me off to the King’s estate.” The relentless publicists are Eurovision’s real heroes, pitching their artists in ludicrously bombastic terms. Latvia’s Dons creates “compelling, soul-stirring melodies,” we’re told. Luna “draws as much kind energy from the Moon as possible.” Armenia claims its folk-duo’s songs “have been said to transcend borders,” though it doesn’t explain who, exactly, has said this. And please make sure you’re sitting down for this – Cyprus’s Silia Kapsis, we’re informed, was once “featured in a dance documentary produced by Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas.” Portugal’s Iolanda, by contrast, is hyped as …checks notes… “a promising singer.” Sorry, Iolanda. Eurovision’s contestants are a humble bunch; all they want to do is sing their songs and heal our planet. “I tend to believe that we can change something with this show,” Joost Klein says. “This is quantum physics, bro,” adds Loreen. “We’re balancing things up in the world right now.” One might ask: if singing can really fix the world, why don’t these people just sing more? Why do they ever stop? Why isn’t a Eurovision contestant airdropped into every conflict zone in a sequined flak jacket, to wail and emote as loud as they can, until all the world’s leader are sat around a campfire listening to Italy’s Angelina Mango strum “Wonderwall” on her guitar? The reality is that a significant portion of Eurovision’s fanbase is uncomfortable with theparticipation of Israelduring the country’s war on Gaza; climate activist Greta Thunberg led an anti-war protest in Malmo on Thursday, and another is planned on Saturday to coincide with the final. Israel’s contestant Eden Golan was audibly booed during the semi-final. The  European Broadcasting Union defended the decision to keep Israel at the competition to CNN this week. But for four hours on Saturday night, much of Europe will enjoy the escape that contestants are promising to provide. They’ll sit and watch obediently as a procession of sad-looking men wail about their exes in various states of undress. They’ll cheer on fierce girlbosses and overly-coiffed double acts as they drain Malmo’s supply of dry ice. And they’ll become entranced with a new set of oddballs gunning straight for the continent’s hearts. As Loreen says: “It’s a hub of love… you wanna join?”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Entertainment/eurovision-baby-lasagne-nemo-abba-preview-intl/index.html,CNN,No title found,,2

So just in time forPulitzer season, CNN has taken on the earnest task of studiously watching rehearsals and carefully analyzing every song, to bring you this: the definitive guide to the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. Artists have been competing in two semi-finals this week, and 26 made it to Saturday’s grand final, which starts at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. EST) in Malmo. To quote Malta’s vocal gymnast Sarah Bonnici: “Here we go aga…aaa..aaa..aa…ain, huh?” For the rest of Europe, hosting Eurovision is an unimaginable honor. For Sweden, it’s beginning to feel like that “quirky” friend’s improv troupe you’d promised you’d see, then promptly forgot about until the last minute, just as you’re stepping into a bubble bath with a glass of Pinot Grigio. This year’s fan park isa bit budget, complain seasoned eurofans. Public rehearsals were half-full, and tickets remain for the final, with mere hours to go. Some even claim the show’s slogan - “United by Music” - may be influenced by last year’s slogan, “United by Music.” But Eurovision is a special part of the cultural calendar. “This community is the whole palette of what we are. Goofy, serious, nerdy,” Loreen says, counting adjectives on some unnecessarily long, golden fingernails. “Everything that you can imagine.” If there’s one thing the contest has taught her, it’s this: “You can actually feel real, authentic love for people that you don’t know, but youdoknow… you know?” Loreen will be performing as a guest during Saturday’s final, while 22-year-old identical twins Marcus and Martinus take the daunting mantle of competing for the host country. “We’re very competitive people; I think we’re the most competitive in the whole competition,” they say without a trace of irony. This year’s slim favorite is Baby Lasagne, whose arena-pounding anthem “Rim Tim Tagi Dim” describes a brain drain affecting Croatian towns. “Ay, I’m a big boy now; I’m going away and I sold my cow,” he chants. But Mr. Lasagne is nothing if not modest. He credits his fiancée with helping him launch his career – “She’s the lasagne, and I’m just the baby,” he tells CNN. “I don’t even like lasagne that much,” he adds, disappointingly. “I mean, it’s OK. I eat it a few times a year.” He’s juking it out with Switzerland’s Nemo, who came up with genre-bending epic “The Code” at Eurovision camp, a place whose mere mention would induce bewilderment to the non-European mind. “It was like a playground,” Nemo says. But now Nemo’s at the real thing, “and it’s even bigger and crazier than I expected it to be.” Ireland’s Bambie Thug is surging as the final approaches, and the Netherland’s Joost Klein is in with a shot. “I don’t mind winning, and I also don’t mind losing. I love being,” he says. No-one has had a bigger nightmare in Malmo than Windows95Man, whose entire persona revolves around an operating system whose name and logo cannot legally be shown at Eurovision. Teemu Keisteri, the genius behind the act, decided to wear a blurred version of the logo on his T-shirt instead. And he wears little else; Finland’s performance sees Windows95Man hatch from a giant egg, then run around with no trousers on for two minutes, before – spoiler alert – he’s eventually reunited with a pair of denim hot pants that descend from the ceiling. “In my late twenties, I figured out that I don’t need to be normal,” Windows95Man tells CNN. “I cannot control how the world sees my art.” And what is the message of this artwork, exactly? Windows95Man sums it up like this: “If Daddy is a little bit naked, it’s not so serious.” Which is not remotely a creepy thing to say. Europe is utterly obsessed with Eurovision. It’s all they think about year-round. Just ask Greece’s contestant, Marina Satti. “When I grew up I didn’t have a TV, so I kind of lost track,” she says. OK, never mind then. But more than 150 million people do watch every year. Some 129 artists entered San Marino’s national selection – around one Eurovision wannabe for every 260 people living in the microstate. And the contest is as much about the lovable weirdos as it is the winners. CNN’s prestigious, first annual award for the worst Eurovision lyric was hotly contested. We had some spectacular, cliched imagery to consider; Iceland’s Hera Bjork is “standing on the edge of a promise,” Saba is “throwing memories in the air,” and Slimane wants to “create an ocean in the fire.” “Hurricanes are roaming, but you take away the pain,” croons Azerbaijan’sFahree, who’s dressed like he’s come straight from the future – but not a cool part of the future, just a 23rd-century Italian restaurant with a poor hygiene rating. “Shining in a tiger’s eyes, only I can find my future,” Poland’s Luna sings, in a truly nonsensical piece of penmanship that failed to propel her to the final. But Norway’s Gåte take the crown, for this unemotional bit of scene-setting: “I was a very fine and beautiful maiden, with an evil stepmother. My mother had died,” the band explains at the start of their track. “She transformed me into a sword and a needle, and sent me off to the King’s estate.” The relentless publicists are Eurovision’s real heroes, pitching their artists in ludicrously bombastic terms. Latvia’s Dons creates “compelling, soul-stirring melodies,” we’re told. Luna “draws as much kind energy from the Moon as possible.” Armenia claims its folk-duo’s songs “have been said to transcend borders,” though it doesn’t explain who, exactly, has said this. And please make sure you’re sitting down for this – Cyprus’s Silia Kapsis, we’re informed, was once “featured in a dance documentary produced by Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas.” Portugal’s Iolanda, by contrast, is hyped as …checks notes… “a promising singer.” Sorry, Iolanda. Eurovision’s contestants are a humble bunch; all they want to do is sing their songs and heal our planet. “I tend to believe that we can change something with this show,” Joost Klein says. “This is quantum physics, bro,” adds Loreen. “We’re balancing things up in the world right now.” One might ask: if singing can really fix the world, why don’t these people just sing more? Why do they ever stop? Why isn’t a Eurovision contestant airdropped into every conflict zone in a sequined flak jacket, to wail and emote as loud as they can, until all the world’s leader are sat around a campfire listening to Italy’s Angelina Mango strum “Wonderwall” on her guitar? The reality is that a significant portion of Eurovision’s fanbase is uncomfortable with theparticipation of Israelduring the country’s war on Gaza; climate activist Greta Thunberg led an anti-war protest in Malmo on Thursday, and another is planned on Saturday to coincide with the final. Israel’s contestant Eden Golan was audibly booed during the semi-final. The  European Broadcasting Union defended the decision to keep Israel at the competition to CNN this week. But for four hours on Saturday night, much of Europe will enjoy the escape that contestants are promising to provide. They’ll sit and watch obediently as a procession of sad-looking men wail about their exes in various states of undress. They’ll cheer on fierce girlbosses and overly-coiffed double acts as they drain Malmo’s supply of dry ice. And they’ll become entranced with a new set of oddballs gunning straight for the continent’s hearts.

43,Entertainment,"Brian Wilson, musician and founding member of the hit ’60s rock band The Beach Boys, has been placed under a conservatorship following a Los Angeles court ruling on Thursday. Judge Gus T. May of the Los Angeles Superior Court found “clear and convincing evidence” that a conservatorship is necessary, court documents said, noting that Wilson consents to the conservatorship. According to the court documents, Wilson is “unable to care for his person,” has a “Major Neurocognitive Disorder” and “lacks capacity to give informed medical consent for medications.” Wilson’s conservators are ordered to consult with his children regarding all material related healthcare decisions, the court documents said. According to the Wilson family, the decision to place Brian under a conservatorship came following the death of his wife, Melinda Wilson, in January. At the time, Wilsoncalled his wife his “anchor,”saying in a post on his website that “Melinda was more than my wife. She was my savior. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career. She encouraged me to make the music that was closest to my heart.” In astatement published in February, the Wilson family said that after “careful consideration and consultation” among Brian, his children, his housekeeper and his doctors, “longtime Wilson family representatives LeeAnn Hard and Jean Sievers will serve as Brian’s co-conservators of the person” following Melinda’s passing. This decision was made, the statement said, to “ensure that there will be no extreme changes to the household,” as well as making sure that “Brian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for by (housekeeper) Gloria Ramos and the wonderful team at the house who have been in place for many years helping take care of the family.” “Brian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses,” the family’s statement concluded. Wilson has had a tumultuous relationship with the spotlight, having suffered from fame-induced stress, depression, and drug addiction in the past. He decided to quit touring with his band after a nervous breakdown in 1964, though he continued to write, arrange, produce and record The Beach Boys’ music. Wilson and The Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001. Wilson has also won two Grammy Awards as a solo artist, for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2005 and Best Historical Album in 2013.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Entertainment/beach-boys-brian-wilson-conservatorship-judge-rules-intl-scli/index.html,CNN,No title found,,2

Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it’s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity – the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren – the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether “Planet of the Apes” swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What’s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) – an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom – attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (“The Witcher’s”Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the “Maze Runner” movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing “The Planet of the Apes” but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run.

47,Politics,"Independent presidential candidateRobert F. Kennedy Jr.walked back hisopposition to any government limits on abortion accessina social media postFriday evening after coming under fire from anti-abortion advocates, including from within his own campaign. Kennedy said he believes “abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks,” while later adding he believes abortion should be restricted “in the final months of pregnancy.” Related articleTrump campaign sees RFK Jr. as a political problem – and wants him neutralized “Abortion has been a notoriously divisive issue in America, but actually I see an emerging consensus — abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks, and restricted thereafter,” Kennedy wrote on social media Friday. “Even in the reddest of red states, voters reject total abortion bans. And on the other end, almost no one supports gruesome third-trimester abortions except to save the life of the mother.” “I support the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point. I believe that point should be when the baby is viable outside the womb. Therefore I would allow appropriate restrictions on abortion in the final months of pregnancy, just as Roe v. Wade did,” he added. Kennedy’s comments come after he told podcast host Sage Steele he opposed any government limits on abortion access, even keeping abortion legal up until shortly prior to the delivery date of a child. That position drew condemnation from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, which said his comments rendered him “unacceptable to millions of pro-life voters nationwide.” On Friday, Angela Stanton King – a Kennedy campaign adviser who has helped him with outreach to Black voters and with criminal justice and abortion policies – criticized Kennedy’s opposition to government limits on abortion access. Later Friday, Stanton King said in asocial media postthat she spoke with Kennedy and said he agreed to clarify his position on abortion. The incident marks the second time where Kennedy has taken a clear-cut position on government limits on abortion access only for Kennedy’s comments to be walked back shortly afterwards.

48,Politics,"TheBiden administrationmoved Friday to terminate a decades-old agreement that governs conditions for migrant children in government custody, according to a court filing, which argues that the settlement was meant to be temporary. The 1997Flores settlement, as the agreement is known, requires the government to release children from government custody without unnecessary delay to sponsors, like parents or adult relatives, and dictates conditions by which children are held. The Health and Human Services Department is charged with the care of unaccompanied migrant children. The Biden administration has previously signaled that it planned to end the Flores agreement, instead preparing a federal regulation that, the administration argues, “faithfully implements” the requirements spelled out in the settlement, provides additional protections and responds to “unforeseen changed circumstances since 1997.” The regulation was published in late April. “By its own terms the FSA was meant to be temporary. The parties initially agreed that the FSA would terminate no later than five years after final court approval and then later agreed that the FSA would terminate 45 days after the INS published final regulations implementing the FSA,” Friday’s court filing reads. “The Rule is expansive and responsive to the changing needs of ORR’s (Unaccompanied Children) Program. ORR anticipates it will guide its operations and provide needed protections to unaccompanied children for years to come,” the filing adds, referring to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency within HHS. But immigration attorneys have expressed concern over the lack of outside oversight if the Flores settlement is terminated. “If the government were to prevail in its motion, HHS would no longer be bound by the Flores settlement. As Flores counsel, we would no longer be able to interview children in HHS custody, or file motions to enforce when the rights guaranteed by Flores are denied to children in HHS custody,” said Neha Desai, senior director of immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.

49,Politics,"TheBiden administration said Fridaythat it is “reasonable to assess” that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces inGazain ways that are “inconsistent” with international humanitarian law but stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Thereportwhich wasdrafted by the State Departmentsaid that investigations into potential violations are ongoing but noted that the US does “not have complete information to verify” whether the US weapons “were specifically used” in alleged violations of international humanitarian law. “Given the nature of the conflict in Gaza, with Hamas seeking to hide behind civilian populations and infrastructure and expose them to Israeli military action, as well as the lack of USG personnel on the ground in Gaza, it is difficult to assess or reach conclusive findings on individual incidents. Nevertheless, given Israel’s significant reliance on U.S.-made defense articles, it is reasonable to assess that defense articles covered under NSM-20 have been used by Israeli security forces since October 7 in instances inconsistent with its IHL obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm,” the report said. The report, which covers the period from the outbreak of thewar with Hamason October 7 to late April, did not find that Israel has withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza in violation of US law. Although the report does not find Israel in violation of either of the terms of the memorandum, it is sharply critical of the toll of Israel’s military campaign. The findings of the report mark another stark moment in US-Israeli relations in the same week President Joe Bidenthreatened to restrict weapons transfersif Israel goes ahead with a major offensive in Rafah. Still, the ultimate finding that Israel’s assurances made under the national security memorandum are “credible and reliable” has already raised scrutiny among some lawmakers and incredulity among human rights and humanitarian organizations. The report did not mandate any actions be taken by the Israeli government, and it does not trigger any policy changes. The administration has largely avoided restricting military assistance to Israel, but in a significant shift ahead of the release of the report, Biden declared publicly in an interview with CNN this week that if Israel proceeds with a major offensive in the Gazan city, he would restrict the transfer of certain offensive weapons to Israel. The high-stakes report was declassified andtransmitted to Capitol Hill on Friday afternoon. The administration was required to make a determination on those two matters under a February national security memorandum, which Biden issued under pressure from Democratic lawmakers. It was the first time the US government had to make an assessment about Israel’s conduct in the seven months of the war with Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the terror group’s brutal October 7 attack, that has left more than 34,000 people dead and much of the coastal enclave destroyed. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the driving force behind the creation of the national security memorandum, expressed disappointment in the report. “The administration ducked all the hard questions about making the actual determination,” the Maryland Democrat told reporters Friday evening. “I think what they’re trying to do is make clear that they recognize how bad the situation is, but they don’t want to have to take any action to hold the Netanyahu government accountable for what’s happening.” Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, agreed with Van Hollen’s remarks, telling CNN that the report is “a massive diplomatic dodge.” “On the one hand, it says that it’s very reasonable to conclude that there’s been restriction of aid, it’s very reasonable to conclude that our weapons have been used in violation of international law and then it proceeds to say that we just don’t want to give an answer on that yet,” Merkley said on “Erin Burnett OutFront.” The Oregon Democrat is one of the few members of Congress to step foot in Rafah, visiting in January. “Clearly, Politics come into this and strategy comes into this, but it is frustrating because it’s so important at this moment that we use the leverage we have to persuade Israel to change its conduct,” he said. Earlier Friday, Van Hollen also said that “the purpose of this report was not to provide a snapshot in time” and accused the administration of taking Israel’s assurances at “face value,” despite investigations by human rights groups finding violations of the law. However, a senior State Department official said that it was always intended to be retrospective, and that there are processes underway to evaluate ongoing activity. There is no deadline for any conclusions to be made under those processes. The report notes that “in any conflict involving foreign partners, it is often difficult to make swift, definitive assessments or determinations on whether specific U.S. defense articles or services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law.” “However, there have been sufficient reported incidents to raise serious concerns,” it said. “While Israel has the knowledge, experience, and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations, the results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases,” the report said. According to the senior State Department official, the compilation of the report has been a useful tool for the Biden administration to go to the government of Israel and insist on getting information, and on behavior changes. That official said the report would be shared with the Israeli government. Biden administration officials have for months called on Israel to do more to curb the civilian death toll and allow more aid into Gaza. On humanitarian aid, the report notes the US government “has had deep concerns during the period since October 7 about action and inaction by Israel that contributed significantly to a lack of sustained and predictable delivery of needed assistance at scale, and the overall level reaching Palestinian civilians – while improved – remains insufficient.” However, it states that they “do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance within the meaning of section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act,” which bars assistance to governments found to be intentionally restricting aid. The report calls the “the impact of Israel’s military operations on humanitarian actors” a specific area of concern, citing a series of incidents, including thedeadly strikeon a World Central Kitchen aid convoy. Following that strike last month, Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in a call that Israel had to do more to address the humanitarian situation or there would be a change in US policy. In recent weeks, US officials said Israel had taken important measures following that conversation, but that more still needed to be done. However, following the launch of “limited” Israeli military operations in Rafah, where millions of Palestinians have fled, humanitarian aid access has once again plummeted. The report was the subject of intense debate for months across the administration. Human rights organizations have assessed that Israel’s military campaign has violated humanitarian law. Late last month, Amnesty International assessed that US-supplied weapons to Israel have been used “in serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and in a manner that is inconsistent with US law and policy.” An Amnesty International official said Friday that “this report seems like the international version of ‘thoughts and prayers’: admitting there’s a problem but not doing anything meaningful to prevent the further loss of lives.” “Despite President Biden’s vague comments earlier this week, his administration today made its position loud and clear: it points fingers and takes swift action when an actor the US government considers an adversary violates international law, but treats the government of Israel as above the law, even while acknowledging the overwhelming evidence that Israeli forces are violating international law and killing Palestinian civilians with US weapons on US taxpayer dime,” said Amanda Klasing, National Director of Government Relations and Advocacy at Amnesty International USA. Van Hollen on Friday said that “it is not credible that the US government has less information than organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam.” A senior State Department official said they couldn’t speak to the standards for the assessments made by those organizations but said the US government process was very diligent and took into consideration any accountability measures undertaken by the Israeli government. The president also acknowledged to CNN that “civilians have been killed as a consequence of” US-supplied bombs. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said Biden was speaking to “the tragic loss of civilian life throughout this conflict,” not a legal determination under international humanitarian law. Humanitarian aid organizations also questioned the findings of the report. “We are confused and dismayed by the Biden administration’s report to Congress, and in particular, its findings that Israel is not impeding the provision of aid to Gaza,” said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps. “Humanitarian organizations have publicly and repeatedly detailed a litany of obstructions by Israel over the last seven months that have made it impossible to deliver humanitarian assistance to the 2.2 million people in Gaza whose lives depend on it,” she said. “Yet more compelling than the testimony of aid organizations is the horrifying situation of the population of Gaza, trapped in a conflict zone and facing starvation,” she continued. “If humanitarian aid were being adequately facilitated—as the NSM calls for—1.1 million people would not be facing catastrophic famine conditions a few miles away from available food. The very fact that the US government has airdropped assistance and spent significant effort and resources constructing a floating pier for maritime deliveries indicates officials had already come to the conclusion that aid delivery was being ‘directly or indirectly’ impeded.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/biden-israel-gaza-war-report/index.html,CNN,Biden admin says it’s ‘reasonable to assess’ Israel used American weapons in ways ‘inconsistent’ with international law,,0

Officials said a US delegation will travel to Niger over the weekend to discuss how it will be carried out. “We’ll make the most out of the situation that was presented to us but the intent is in Niger, to draw down to a level that the Nigerians can live with,” Chris Maier, assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, told CNN. “Niger is pretty profound in the decision of the government there … to have us depart or at least go to very low numbers,” Maier said. Among the issues defense officials must resolve in their meetings with Niger’s government is an agreement to allow US military flights in and out of the country. Since the coup in July, airspace has been closed over Niger to foreign militaries who have all had to submit individual requests for airspace to conduct military flights, one US official told CNN. A US military official explained that the withdrawal will come in phases over a period of months. The phase currently happening is the breakdown of anything not necessary for life or safety and security, which is being prepped to be taken out of the country. The footprint will continue to shrink in phases as equipment and personnel not deemed necessary are moved out of country. The official also said that the hope of having a small number of troops remaining in the country is largely wishful thinking at this point despite the conversations still ongoing, as Niger’s government has been clear it wants US forces out. US officials said the volatile situation in Niger is just the latest signal of growing instability on the continent of Africa, where a wave of military coups over the last several years has imperiled the American presence there and offered an opportunity for Russia to grow its influence. The US military footprint in Africa is relatively small and nominally is focused on counterterrorism efforts, but officials also believe that Africa is key in the global battle for influence between Russia and the United States. Niger’s military governmentendedits military agreement with the US in March, andfor several months nowRussian forces have been operating in different camps of the same base housing US troops. In addition to Niger’s expulsion of US forces, Chad has threatened to cancel its status of forces agreement with the US, further destabilizing the US’ presence on the continent. Although the small number of US troops in Chad makes it a less obvious military loss, a third US official said that it could be a bellwether for stability — and American influence — across the continent. Gen. Michael Langley, the head of US Africa Command,told Congress in Marchthat a “number of countries” in Africa were “at the tipping point of actually being captured by the Russian Federation as they are spreading some of their false narratives.” Maier echoed the same, saying Russia and China have “invested a lot more than we have” in information operations, which helps spread their influence. American officials said it is difficult for the US to compete directly with what Russia is willing to offer some of the military leaders that have taken over governments in Africa. Russia can offer immediate security assistance — including weapons — in the fight against terrorism, assistance that comes with far fewer conditions than American aid. “My concern among others is that the partnership that we rely on fundamentally to, we hope, help these countries is not there anymore, or they’ve replaced it in some instances with the elixir of Russia that promises things that are more rapid that might be what some of these governments, especially the coup governments, think they need in the short term,” Maier said. The fear, according to the second US official, is that growing instability could create a swath of nations across Africa where the US can’t operate safely but Russia potentially can. That could have dramatic security implications beyond Africa, particularly if it imperils safe US access to the Mediterranean where the US military has been operating since Hamas’ invasion of Israel in October. When it comes to Africa, the US “may be in a situation where we’re increasingly on the outside looking in,” Maier said. But he added that it could present an opportunity to show the ineffectiveness of Russia’s offers to African nations. “Now some of these coup regimes have decided that they are going to go with the Russians, so now they’re the dog that caught the car,” he said. “And if there aren’t results — not only security space, but a lot of the other things that are part of governance — then the facts will start to outstrip even the most sophisticated mis and disinformation over time.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/us-niger-forces-talks/index.html,CNN,"US hopes to maintain some forces in Niger as talks on withdrawal continue, officials say",,0

52,Politics,"Supreme Court JusticeClarence Thomasrepeatedly pushed back on his critics during remarks Friday at a judicial conference in Alabama, lamenting what he described as the “nastiness” and “lies” directed at him and calling Washington a “hideous place.” Asked whether his jurisprudence required a degree of courage, Thomas said he didn’t view himself as courageous – particularly when compared with servicemembers, and firefighters and people who defuse bombs. Thomas said he was simply doing his job. “Being in Washington, you have to get used to particularly people who are reckless,” Thomas, a conservative and the court’s most senior associate justice, said. “They don’t bomb you, necessarily, but they bomb your reputation or your good name or your honor. And that’s not a crime but they can do as much harm that way.” Speaking at the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals conference in Point Clear, Alabama, Thomas argued that it would be a disservice to those soldiers and first responders “not to sit at my desk and make decisions with a lifetime appointment that we know are the right decisions.” Thomas, while not speaking directly to aseries of reports about ethicsthat have plagued him for months, repeatedly returned to his critics without prompting from US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, who moderated the discussion. “My wife and I, the last two or three years, it’s been – just the nastiness and the lies – it’s just incredible,” Thomas said. Related articleJudges from around the country say Trump can be held accountable for January 6. What will the Supreme Court say? Thomas and his wife, Ginni, have been the target of a good deal of criticism in recent years. Several of Thomas’ critics, including Democratic members of Congress, havecalled on him to recuse himselffrom Supreme Court cases involving theJanuary 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitolbecause of his wife’s efforts to reverse the 2020 presidential election in former President Donald Trump’s favor. Ginni Thomas hasacknowledged attending Trump’s rallybefore the Capitol attack. Justice Thomas hasdeclined to recuse himselffrom cases this year involving the January 6 attack, including a blockbuster appeal regarding Trump’s claims of absolute immunity from criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the election results. Thomas has also faced criticism for accepting private jet travel and posh vacations from Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, first reported byProPublica. In response to the blowback, Thomasupdated his financial disclosure forms, and the Supreme Courtadopted a code of conductfor the first time last year. At one point on Friday, Thomas told a story about a walk he took with a friend before breaking off into an aside. “That’s before they started attacking my friends,” Thomas said. “I hope I still have some.” As he has in the past, Thomas also spared little criticism for Washington, DC. “I think what you’re gonna find, and especially in Washington, [is] people pride themselves in being awful,” Thomas said one point. The remark elicited laughter in the room, until Thomas continued. “It is a hideous place, as far as I’m concerned,” Thomas said, noting that he liked to visit other places where people “don’t pride themselves in doing harmful things merely because they have the capacity to do it.” Thomas, 75, also appeared to lament aloss of trust within the Supreme Court, telling the conference that thestunning leak of a draft abortion opinion in 2022wouldn’t have happened when he joined the court in 1991. It wasn’t the first time Thomas has made those points – he once likened the leak to an “infidelity” – but his remarks Friday suggested the fallout from the leak of the decision overturning Roe v. Wade may still be top of mind. Related articleJustice Clarence Thomas chooses not to recuse himself from another January 6-related case “We may have been a dysfunctional family, but we were a family,” Thomas said of the court when he first joined in 1991. “It would be inconceivable that anyone would leak an opinion of the court or do anything to intentionally harm one another.” Thomas also became the latest justice in recent weeks to raise concern with the Supreme Court’s applications docket, the process the court uses to handle emergency requests. That docket has come under fierce criticism in recent years, in part because the court often decides the requests on a short timeline, usually without oral argument and often with orders that do not indicate how the justices voted. “I think there’s some concern about that among my colleagues – certainly with me – because it short circuits our process,” Thomas said. “The way that we’re doing it now, I think, is not a thorough way of dealing with very, very difficult issues.” As he returned to his critics, Thomas suggested the lesson he had taken away from the last year of controversy was that he would not react with “nastiness for nastiness.” “You have some choices. You don’t get to prevent people from doing horrible things or saying horrible things,” Thomas said. But, he said, he had come to accept “the fact that they can’t change you unless you permit that.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/clarence-thomas-pushes-back-critics/index.html,CNN,Justice Clarence Thomas decries Washington as ‘hideous’ and pushes back on ‘nastiness’ of critics,,0
53,Politics,"AsRobert F. Kennedy Jr.sustains his support in public polls and makes steady progress on gaining ballot access in states across the country, his independent presidential bid is confounding the campaign of former President Donald Trump and its Republican allies. In recent weeks, Kennedy has gone from a perceived nuisance to a political problem that the Trump campaign is eager to swiftly extinguish, according to conversations with multiple people close to the former president. Trump himself has noticeably escalated his attacks on Kennedy in recent weeks, includingposting a lengthy videoto social media on Thursday that labeled him as a “Democrat plant” who will pull votes away from his campaign to help President Joe Biden, and urged Republicans not to cast a “wasted protest vote.” The shift comes asrecent pollsshow that Kennedy could cut into Trump’s support just as much as he could draw votes away from Biden, with the results serving as an apparent warning for Republicans who have dismissed the independent candidate thus far, the sources say. The consensus held by Trump’s top advisers and allies had long been that Biden has more to lose from the presence of independents, and Kennedy specifically, in November. But the former president’s team has taken notice of Kennedy’s standing in some state polls and uptick in media attention, including regular appearances on conservative networks like Newsmax and Fox News, during which he’s openly courted anti-establishment voters. That’s sparked a more concerted effort from Republicans to try and prevent Kennedy from eating into any pro-Trump support. Trump’s advisers and those close to the former president told CNN they still view Kennedy as likely hurting Biden more. However, they privately acknowledge that his impact on Trump’s candidacy varies on a state-by-state basis. They also dismiss the notion that he could be perceived as a serious threat to the former president, but they argue their increased attacks against Kennedy are more an effort to halt any consideration from current or potential Trump supporters from casting their vote for the independent candidate. “RFK is a problem, not a threat,” one senior Trump adviser told CNN, who singled out Pennsylvania as one critical battleground state where Kennedy could hurt Trump, arguing voters in the Keystone State may be drawn more to a candidate who is neither Trump nor Biden. As CNN previously reported, there are some in Trump’s orbit who are concerned about Kennedy qualifying for the presidential debates and believe that having earlier debates would make it easier to keep Kennedy off the stage before he could gather further momentum in the polls. “It’s not that he’s a threat. A lot of it depends on the state, and it’s still not clear who he’s taking more from,” a person close to Trump said. “If we can make people on the right, who might be open minded to him, hate him very easily because he’s so liberal. Why not weigh him down as much as possible with conservative or conservative leaning voters?” CNN has reached out to Kennedy’s campaign for comment. Trump’s teamcreated a playbook months agoto go on offense against Kennedy and define him as a “liberal parading in conservative’s clothing,” as one senior Trump adviser described him to CNN, pointing to a series of his policies on climate change and abortion to paint him as part of the progressive wing of the Democratic party. But in the months since, the messaging has varied. While Trump’s team and Republican National Committee officials stuck to the script and painted Kennedy as a far-left Democrat who doesn’t embody conservative values, the former president himself often had a different take. At a campaign stop at a Harlem bodega during Trump’s criminal trial last month, the former president ignored questions about whether he would consider Kennedy as a potential running mate, after Kennedy suggested emissaries of Trump’s had reached out about the prospect — something Trump’s campaign adamantly denied. Trump instead offered mild praise of Kennedy. Days later, he called Kennedy “a nice guy” during an interview with Real America’s Voice, adding he wasn’t sure whether Kennedy hurt him or Biden more. “Well, I think he’s a nice guy. I’ve known him. He’s extremely liberal. He’s more liberal than anybody,” Trump told the radio host. “They say he hurts Biden, I think, I’m not sure that that’s true. But he might hurt Biden a little bit more, you don’t know.” Flash forward to May, and Trump has adopted a more aggressive stance toward his independent rival. He has repeatedly attacked Kennedy on Truth Social, includinglabeling himas “a Radical Left Lunatic” and calling him “the dumbest member of the Kennedy Clan,” as well as needling Kennedy’s positions on vaccines and environmental policy, among others. Asked about Trump ratcheting up his attacks, a Trump campaign adviser told CNN: “We’ve seen an uptick in the amount of coverage he’s getting. And you know, we just want to reiterate our message. We want Trump to do what he does, what he does with everyone else. He separates the person from the politician.” CNN’s Aaron Pellish contributed to this story.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/trump-campaign-rfk-jr/index.html,CNN,Trump campaign sees RFK Jr. as a political problem – and wants him neutralized,,0

55,Politics,"The US announced on Friday a new $400 million military aid package toUkraine. The package includes weapons Ukraine has been asking for, including Patriot missile system munitions, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMAR) systems and ammunition, Stinger anti-air missiles, 155mm artillery rounds, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs), among other equipment. “As President Biden has made clear, the United States and the international coalition we have assembled will continue to stand with Ukraine in its defense of its freedom,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. The announcement marks the second Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package since President Joe Biden signed a long-delayed national security supplemental securing $60 billion in funding for Ukraine. Last month, just moments after Biden signed the legislation, the US announced a $1 billion PDA package to Ukraine. Bidensaid at the timethat shipments of the equipment to Ukraine would begin “in the next few hours.” And just two days later, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced ahistoric $6 billionlong-term investment package to purchase new equipment for Ukraine. The $6 billion package — the largest the US has announced — is under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). USAI is different from than the PDA package in that it contracts with the US defense industry to purchase new equipment, whereas PDAs pull equipment from existing US stocks. While some equipment under the PDA can arrive within days of the announcement, support under USAI takes longer; Austin said at the time that the Pentagon was “going to move as fast as we can to get them the capability as fast as industry can produce.” On Friday, the State Department also announced the $30 million sale of HIMARS to Ukraine, a rocket launcher that Kyiv’s military has used to great effect against Russian forces. The emergency sale, which includes three of the HIMARS vehicles, will be paid for by Germany on behalf of Ukraine. Butofficials have told CNNthat Russia is seeking to exploit that lag time and step up its attacks on Ukraine as the embattled country waits for assistance to arrive. The lag in those shipments is made more severe given the months-long delay in aid as Congress debated the supplemental legislation. On Wednesday evening, Ukrainian authorities said Russia launched dozens of missiles and drones on Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure. On Friday, a Ukrainian military source told CNN that Russian forces had penetrated at least one kilometer inside northern Ukraine in an assault on a border town on Thursday evening. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Russia “launched a new wave of counteroffensive actions in ([northern Kharkiv region). Ukraine met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery.” “But our military and military command were aware of this and anticipated their forces to meet the enemy with fire,” he said. “Now there is a fierce battle in this area. … I think as of now we have stopped the enemy with artillery fire.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.

56,Politics,"Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh told an Austin judicial conference on Friday that his experience in the George W. Bush administration has made him more skeptical of presidential assertions of regulatory power. His comments on the issue (he also discussed Taylor Swift and Caitlin Clark) were especially salient in light of the many challenges to the Biden administration policies on which the court is expected to rule by the end of June. Related galleryIn pictures: Taylor Swift’s ‘Eras Tour’ Referring to his 2001-2006 tenure as a lawyer for Bush, Kavanaugh said he was “in the room” as regulations were written and saw first-hand the “pressures” on administrations to push the limits of their statutory power, whether over the environment, immigration or health care. “It gives me a good, for want of a better term, B.S. detector,” he said. “When the executive branch says, ‘We can’t possibly do this.’ … I think to myself … I saw it done.” Kavanaugh observed that presidential candidates regularly campaign on a reform agenda but then become stymied in their priorities by the legislative process and congressional gridlock. That creates an incentive for presidents to push the boundaries of their regulatory authority, he said, emphasizing that the phenomenon affects both political parties. “The judiciary is there to help police those boundaries,” Kavanaugh said. The comments of Kavanaugh, a 2018 appointee of former President Donald Trump, may hint at the conservative court majority’s resolution of pending disputes testing the bounds of an array of federal regulation. Since the six-justice conservative majority coalesced in 2020, the court has taken longer strides to constrain federal regulators, from the environment and consumer finance to public health and workplace safety.

Natural Resources Defense Council, that requires federal judges to defer to US agencies’ views of their statutory mandates for policy. Business groups, backed by Republican-run states, contend the Chevron principle has led to unlawful bureaucratic intrusions and given the government the upper hand in litigation. The Biden administration, defending the Chevron precedent and multiple agency policies now under challenge, has stressed the importance of executive-branch expertise and comprehensive nationwide protections for the public good. Kavanaugh’s hourlong appearance Friday in the ballroom of an Austin hotel came as the high court enters its tensest weeks, negotiating in private to resolve dozens of cases by the traditional late June deadline. He answered questions from 5th Circuit Chief Judge Priscilla Richman at the circuit’s annual judicial conference. Related article‘Pretty unheard of’: Caitlin Clark draws 13,000 in home preseason debut as Indiana Fever win 83-80 By and large, Richman’s questions were on the lighter side, including those that opened a window on Kavanaugh’s extracurricular life. He said that his two high school daughters, now a sophomore and senior, control much of his off-bench time. He attended his first Taylor Swift concert in 2012, he told Richman after she asked if he had attended anEras Tour concert. Yes, the justice said, Kavanaugh describing himself as “way ahead of the curve” with his Swiftie fandom. And he has taken his daughters to multiple NCAA basketball tournaments, including thefirst round in Iowa last March. The justice recounted that on the Thursday night before that tournament weekend, his older daughter was talking about players she knew, from her own high school basketball team, that would be competing against Iowa’s Caitlin Clark. Kavanaugh’s younger daughter said, “We should go!” A few beats later, Kavanaugh agreed: “We should go. We went. … I got on StubHub, got the tickets, got the flights, probably one of the most expensive 48 hours.” But he added, “To go to Iowa and see the phenomena of Caitlin Clark. That’s a lifetime memory that I did on the spur of the moment.” On a far more serious note about his daughters, Kavanaugh said that they have grown up with constant court police security. Asked about the intense security for individual justices since 2022, when the opinion reversing Roe v. Wade first leaked, the justice said his security detail is “24/7 at the home” and accompanies him when he travels. When Richman asked if protesters still show up at his home, a pattern that intensified after he joined the Dobbs ruling reversing Roe, Kavanaugh said, “occasionally … not as much. I think I’ll leave it there.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/brett-kavanaugh-presidential-power-caitlin-clark-taylor-swift-security/index.html,CNN,"Brett Kavanaugh speaks about presidential power, his Taylor Swift fandom and an expensive trip to see Caitlin Clark",,0

The president, who is currently traveling in San Francisco, signed the Federal Aviation Administration funding extension using the autopen – a device used for automatic signatures – in order to ensure there was no lapse in funding, a White House official said. The bill was transmitted to the White House Friday afternoon, the official said. The use of the autopen, which was first used by President Barack Obama to sign legislation, has been a rarity in the Biden administration. The White House has gone to great lengths at times to fly physical bills to  Biden while he’s traveling abroad, including a $40 billion Ukraine aid package the president signed while in South Korea in 2022 and a 2022 bill to avert a government shutdown while the president was on vacation in St. Croix. The Senate also approved a bipartisan FAA reauthorization bill that renews authority for the agency for the next five years on Thursday night. The House will next need to pass that legislation. That bill would renew authority for the agency for the next five years and aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislationseeks to addressthe nation’s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring, includes strengthened consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays, and would implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions.

One flashpoint centered aroundflights at Reagan National Airportjust outside of Washington, DC – with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package. Ultimately, however, there were no votes on amendments.

58,Politics,"One of Donald Trump’s closest White House aides wrapped up her testimony Friday in theformer president’s hush money trial, clearing the way for the prosecution’s key witness to take the stand on Monday. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer and lawyer, is expected to testify Monday, according to a person familiar with the case, where he will speak to the hush money agreement he helped negotiate in 2016 with Stormy Daniels and how Trump repaid him the following year. Related live-storyMichael Cohen set to testify at Trump hush money trial Monday Cohen’s testimony is the lynchpin to prosecutors’ charges that Trump illegally falsified Business records by concealing the reimbursement of Cohen to keep the payments hidden before the 2016 election. In anticipation of calling the former president’s onetime fixer, however, prosecutors introduced a slew of text messages and phone records into evidence for the jury, via several custodial witnesses. Prosecutors say it’s entirely possible they could rest their case by the end of next week. Here are the takeaways from day 15 of the Trump hush money trial: Cohen is expected to take the stand Monday, putting him face-to-face with his former boss. He is expected to testify to his role in negotiating the hush money payment to Daniels on Trump’s behalf, as well as how he was reimbursed through retainer payments in 2017 that are at the heart of the charges against Trump. With Cohen’s testimony implicating Trump, however, comes all of the baggage that accompanies the former president’s longtime fixer. Cohen himself was federally charged with campaign finance violations, tax crimes and lying to Congress in previous testimony. He’s changed his story as he turned from loyal Trump defender to chief antagonist afterpleading guilty to the federal charges in 2018. His testimony in the fall during Trump’s civil fraud trial foreshadowed some of the challenges prosecutors can face having him on the stand, as he appeared to change his story about the direction he received from Trump about his financial statements during his testimony. Cohen’s credibility with the jury may make-or-break Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case, so it will be high stakes for the prosecution when Cohen is sworn in next week. Ahead of Cohen’s expected testimony, Trump attorney Todd Blanche urged Judge Juan Merchan to order Cohen to stop talking about the trial and Trump. Trump is not allowed to talk about Cohen because of the gag order in place. But, Blanche said, Cohen is nevertheless allowed to attack him, pointing to a TikTok video Cohen posted this week wearing a T-shirt showing Trump behind bars. “Our request that the court order the government to instruct the witness to not talk about president trump or this case until the case is over,” Blanche said. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass responded that prosecutors have repeatedly instructed Cohen and all of the other witnesses in the case not to speak publicly about it. “The fact of the matter is, we have no control over what they do,” he conceded. Merchan has already said he cannot gag witnesses in the case. But he sympathized with Blanche’s position and said that he would “direct the people to communicate to Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements” about this case or Trump. Merchan told the prosecutors to send the message saying that it “comes from the bench and you’re communicating that on behalf of the bench.” Cohen has posted on social media attacking Trump since the trial began, though he claimed at one point he was going to stop. Trump, often in response, has repeatedly been found in violation of the judge’s gag order for his comments about Cohen. Trump exchanged smiles with his former White House assistant Madeleine Westerhout, who wrapped up her testimony Friday that began one day prior. She raised her eyebrows and smiled at Trump who smiled back at her and mouthed something as she left the courtroom. On cross-examination, Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Westerhout to reiterate that she knows the former president to care about his family. Westerhout testified that she remembered Trump was upset after the Stormy Daniels story came out in 2018. Westerhout acknowledged on the stand that he didn’t specifically speak about his family in their conversation about the story, but, “My understanding was he knew it would be hurtful to his family.” Westerhout testified that Trump signed scores of documents a day while multitasking on the phone or in meetings, and she said she’d seen him signing checks without reviewing them. Related articleEx-Trump Org. CFO sentenced to 5 months in jail after testifying falsely about size of Trump triplex apartment She also testified that personal mail like Trump’s checks used a back channel via an employee’s home address so he could get and handle them faster than if they were processed by the White House’s cumbersome system for processing personal mail. Westerhout also distanced Trump from then-Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselbergonce he took office. “In fact, you really don’t recall any calls specifically between him and Allen Weisselberg?” Necheles asked. “No, he spoke to so many people,” Westerhout said. Trump’s former assistant said she’s “not even sure it’s true” that Trump spoke with Weisselberg about a check – something prosecutors have suggested in reference to the Cohen reimbursements. After Westerhout left the stand, prosecutors spent the rest of the day calling a series of custodial witnesses to introduce cell phone records into evidence. It made for a dry day of testimony, but it also provided key evidence that prosecutors plan to use to try to convince the jury that Trump is guilty of falsifying Business records. Those records included a summary of the 34 charges against Trump – 11 invoices, 12 vouchers, and 11 checks. Through a Manhattan district attorney’s office paralegal, prosecutors introduced a summary explaining how the charges correlated with the documents in evidence. In addition, prosecutors introduced a series of text messages between Stormy Daniels’ then-manager Gina Rodriguez and National Enquirer editor in chief Dylan Howard in 2016. In the messages, the two discuss whether American Media Inc. would buy Daniels’ story – and for how much – before giving a play-by-play of the status of the negotiations and payment Cohen ultimately made to Daniels’ attorney in late October 2016. The texts are notable because neither Howard nor Rodriguez is expected to testify in the trial. Some of the texts were introduced through David Pecker, who was Howard’s boss, but prosecutors used a paralegal to show more of them to the jury this week. “We’re not doing the Trump deal,” Rodriguez texted Howard on October 17, 2016. “Keith (Davidson) gave me a heads up. What happened?” Howard responded. “They didn’t pay when they said they would and they keep trying to buy more time,” Rodriguez responded. The texts corroborate what Daniels and Davidson have testified so far that the deal briefly fell apart in mid-October – and will also likely help bolster Cohen’s credibility when he takes the stand next week. Steinglass said that prosecutors expect to call two more witnesses, and then rest. “And I think it’s entirely possible we will rest by the end of next week,” he added. When the prosecution rests, it will be Trump’s turn. It’s not clear how long he will put on a case in defense – a question that is likely to rest largely on whether or not Trump himself takes the stand. The judge also threw a potential curveball of his own on Friday when Trump’s lawyers objected to allowing the settlement agreement of Weisselberg into evidence. Trump’s lawyers argued that the severance agreement was prejudicial to the jury, calling Weisselberg an “uncalled government witness” because he is currently in jail afterpleading guiltyearlier this year to perjury charges. Prosecutors responded that the settlement agreement itself would help to explain why Weisselberg was not called and also argued that they expect Weisselberg to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Merchan interjected by asking prosecutors whether they had actually compelled Weisselberg to testify, which they had not. “It seems to me we want to explain why he’s not here without taking the effort of trying to explain that we tried to get him here,” Merchan said, suggesting they could bring Weisselberg in without the jury present to see what he would say. Prosecutors did not seem thrilled by the idea – Trump’s attorneys noted he wasn’t on prosecutors’ original witness list – but it’s the kind of unexpected appearance that could extend the length of the trial.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/takeaways-friday-may-10-trump-trial/index.html,CNN,Takeaways from Day 15 of the Donald Trump hush money trial,,0
59,Politics,"The Biden administration is set to unveil a sweeping restructuring of former President Donald Trump’s trademarktariffs on Chinese imports,according to sources familiar with the matter. The announcement, expected as early as next week, would see tariffs dialed up significantly in some industries seenas strategic to the US economyand kept in place or dialed back in others deemed less critical to national security, the sources said. Importers of electric vehicles, solar components and critical minerals made in China are likely to see those levies rise significantly – to as high as 100% in the case of electric vehicles, these sources said. The changes come as President Joe Biden refines a campaign pitch based on protecting domestic industries from state-sponsored competition, while encouraging clean energy investments in the US that have become the pillars of his presidential platform. The changes are the result of a mandatory review that the Office of the US Trade Representative began in 2022, two years after the US and China’s “Phase One” trade deal went into effect, formalizing the tariff levels that Trump was known to set on social media. Under US trade law, the economic impact and effectiveness of tariff programs must be studied and investigated every four years. Adam Hodge, former aide at Biden’s National Security Council and the Office of the US Trade Representative, said the new tariffs – taken together with other policies enacted by Treasury and Commerce – should ease some anxiety among the electorate. “The Biden administration has neutralized China as a campaign issue,” said Hodge, now a managing director at Bully Pulpit International. Trump – Biden’s opponent in November and the architect of the existing tariff program that taxes some $300 billion in Chinese goods at US ports of entry –has proposed charginga 60% tariff on all goods coming from China and 10% on goods imported from everywhere else. Biden’s proposal would represent a more curated approach, albeit an approach that is inherently a response to actions already initiated by his predecessor. Some economists have warned that increased tariffs risk reigniting a trade war with China, hurting the US economy in the process. Tariffs are essentially a tax on US Businesses and consumers,adding to the cost of imported goods.That could send inflation higher and hurt job growth. Americans have paid more than $230 billion to date for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum and Chinese-made goods, according toUS Customs and Border Protection. More than half of the duties have been collected during the Biden administration. Strategic importance to the economy, in an election year, also carries political importance. Both candidates have been campaigning across the manufacturing-heavy swing states known as the “blue wall” critical to both candidates’ prior election victories. In an April speech in Pittsburgh,nicknamed “Steel City,” Biden called for the tripling of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and shipbuilding materials – an effort to raise the cost of non-US products to promote American manufacturing and jobs. The Biden administration had planned to release the results of the review in advance of the Pittsburgh speech, the sources familiar with the matter said, but ended up delaying the release. The Office of the US Trade Representative now faces a deadline at the end of May to decide whether companies whose products had been granted exclusions from certain tariffs would see those exclusions extended or denied. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen discussed US concerns with China’s non-market practices in bilateral meetings with Chinese leaders in early April, concerns echoed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken in meetings later that month. Yellen is planning to join other finance ministers in the Group of Seven nations representing the world’s wealthiest democracies in Italy at the end of May, where the group will discuss the agenda for the upcoming June summit in Puglia, Italy. For more than a year, the Biden administration has been urging its allies in the European Union to place hefty tariffs on electric vehicles imported into the bloc, stressing the risk China poses to domestic car manufacturing and urging solidarity in standing up to a non-market economy. “It’s important for the US to make this move in advance of the EU’s investigation into Chinese EVs,” said Clete Willems, partner at Akin Gump and former deputy director of the National Economic Council during the Trump administration. Willems said the US’ position as a first mover on EV tariffs would give the EU “air cover.” The European Commission faces a July 4 deadline to decide how to proceed in its own investigation into electric vehicle subsidies. The White House, Treasury Department and USTR declined to comment.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/joe-biden-tariffs-program-donald-trump/index.html,CNN,"Biden administration set to revamp Trump’s tariff program after multi-year review, sources say",,0
60,Politics,"Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court on Friday to intervene in theongoing legal fightover the state’s congressional districts, urging the high court to quickly resolve a dispute that has essentially left the state without a viable map for this year’s election. The emergency appeal came days after civil rights organizations and a group of Black voters separately asked the Supreme Court to step into the case. “Five days out from May 15 — the date by which the Louisiana Secretary of State needs to begin implementing a congressional map for the 2024 elections — Louisiana has no congressional map,” state officials told the Supreme Court. “Louisiana’s impossible situation in this redistricting cycle would be comical if it were not so serious.” At issue is a map drawn by state lawmakers that included a second majority-Black district in Louisiana’s six-district congressional plan. A conservative-leaning lower courtstruck down that maplast week, finding that it violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause. That new map with the two majority-Black districts was drawn in response to another court order that found an earlier map, which had only one majority-Black district, likely ran afoul of the Voting Rights Act. Civil rights groups say the two rulings have left the state “without a congressional map just months away from the 2024 elections.” The Supreme Court has asked the voters who challenged the second map for a response to the civil rights groups by midday Monday, setting up a possible decision as early as next week, once all the filings are submitted. Louisiana specifically asked the justices Friday to rely on a legal doctrinecalled the Purcell principle, which it sometimes invokes to stay out of messy election lawsuits as voting season approaches. The lower court’s “late-breaking” ruling “plus the court’s blowing through election deadlines in search of an imaginary, litigation-proof 2024 congressional map” should be enough to allow the most recently drawn map to stand for now, the state argued. Because the case raises fundamental questions about how mapmakers consider race when they redraw congressional boundaries every decade, the Supreme Court’s decision could have national implications. It could also affect control of the US House, given the narrow majority Republicans currently hold in that chamber.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/louisiana-congressional-map-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,Louisiana urges Supreme Court to quickly resolve congressional map fight in emergency request,,0
61,Politics,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.said he’s against government limits on abortion at the federal or state level, backing legal abortions through the entire gestational period while arguing the state should not play a role in determining abortion access. In a podcast interview with Sage Steele that was released Wednesday, Kennedy said he doesn’t “trust government to have jurisdiction over people’s bodies” and believes “we need to leave it to the woman … to make those decisions.” Kennedy stressed he believes “every abortion is a tragedy” and pledged as president to make child care more affordable to reduce pressures on women who are considering abortion due to high costs. When pressed by Steele if he supports allowing individual states to determine abortion access for women, Kennedy said, “We shouldn’t have government involved.” “I wouldn’t leave it to the states. My belief is that we should leave it to the woman. We shouldn’t have government involved,” Kennedy said. “Even if it’s full term?” Steele asked, referring to the possibility of an abortion near the expected delivery date of a child. “Even if it’s full term,” Kennedy replied. The position stands in contrast withprevious statementsKennedy has made on abortion, and with how his running mate Nicole Shanahan has characterized his abortion position. In an interview with Steele released last week, Shanahan said, “My understanding is that he absolutely believes in the limits on abortion.” When pressed by Steele to confirm if Kennedy supported no government limits on abortion, Shanahan said, “That is not my understanding of his position, and I think maybe there was a miscommunication there.” In a statement to CNN, Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said the candidate believes “late-term abortions are horrifying” and that the “the mother has the final say, and moral responsibility, in such decisions.” “He is committed to reducing the abortion rate by supporting mothers and families and implementing universally affordable child care,” Spear said. Kennedy’s comments to Steele reflect the most explicit articulation of his views on state or federal gestational limits on abortion. Last year, Kennedy told a reporter he wouldsupport a three-month federal abortion restriction, but his campaign quickly walked back that position. Kennedy has often avoided answering directly whether he supports limits on abortion while highlighting his plan to subsidize child care and expand access to adoption services. Kennedy acknowledged to Steele there is “a compelling argument” that the government should set a gestational limit on abortion access. He also conceded that his position is “not a very satisfactory outcome” because of the potential for “instances where bad things happen.” “I think there’s a very, very good argument, a compelling argument that the state has a interest in protecting a fully formed fetus. I absolutely think that that argument is very convincing,” Kennedy said. “But again, I come down to the fact that I don’t trust the state, and I think we need to trust the woman. And I don’t think that that’s a satisfactory outcome because there’s always going to be instances where bad things happen.” Kennedy said he believes cases where a woman would potentially undergo a late-term abortion would be driven by “extenuating circumstances” but reiterated his belief that the choice to have an abortion should be determined solely by the mother. “I don’t think any woman ever, ever in history has said, ‘I’m going to have a, you know, I’m going to have a baby, I’m going to get pregnant and carry that baby to eight months term and then I’m going to terminate the pregnancy.’ I don’t think anybody wants to do that,” Kennedy said. “I’m sure it has happened. I would say in almost all those cases, there’s extenuating circumstances.” “But I think, ultimately, nobody sets out to do that,” he added later. “And there are always some kind of extenuating circumstances that would make a mother make that kind of choice, a terrible, terrible choice which is, you know, you can’t overstate how bad that is. And I think, ultimately, we have to trust women.” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, slammed Kennedy on Thursday for his remarks, with the group’s president calling him a “true extremist.” “He would use the power of the federal government to wipe out protections for life in the states and impose unlimited abortion on demand all the way up to ‘full term,’ as he puts it, everywhere in America. That makes him unacceptable to millions of pro-life voters nationwide,” Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. Angela Stanton King, a Kennedy campaign adviser who has helped him with outreach to Black voters, criminal justice and abortion policies, criticized the candidate’s comments on Friday. She said it was the first time she had heard him voice such a perspective. “It is inexcusable to take the life of a full-term baby. Abortion at this stage does not prevent the need for delivery, as the baby must still be birthed, whether alive or deceased,” Stanton Kingsaid.

62,Politics,"A federal appeals court on Fridayupheld the contempt-of-Congress convictionof Steve Bannon, the ex-adviser to former President Donald Trump who was found guilty after failing to comply with a subpoena from the House January 6 committee. Bannon’s conviction — and now, the DC Circuit’s affirmation of that conviction — is a boost to Congress’ leverage in its efforts going forward to obtain cooperation in its investigations. The US DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, including his claim that the trial court excluded evidence he should have been allowed to put before the jury in his defense. Bannon was sentenced to four months in federal prison, and that sentence was also upheld Friday by the appeals court. The ruling could pave the way for Bannon to eventually report to prison, though the timing is unclear. The judge who presided over Bannon’s trial previously agreed to let him hold off from serving his sentence while his appeal played out. In its ruling Friday, the three-judge appeals panel gave Bannon time to appeal its ruling to the full DC-based appeals court before it formally notifies the trial judge that the conviction was upheld. Bannon could also turn directly to the Supreme Court for additional appeals, possibly further delaying when he needs to start serving his prison term. Bannon’s attorneys did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. In the DC Circuit’s new ruling, Judge Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, backed the trial judge’s exclusion of an advice-of-counsel defense, as Bannon had claimed he had rebuffed the subpoena because of supposed executive privilege concerns expressed to him by his lawyer. “This exact ‘advice of counsel’ defense is no defense at all,” Garcia wrote, noting that the contempt law only required proof that Bannon “deliberately and intentionally” did not respond to the subpoena. His opinion was joined by Judge Cornelia Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Trump-appointed Judge Justin Walker. The appeals court noted that “the communications from former President Trump’s counsel” that Bannon had tried to rely on to defend his conduct did not purport “to authorize Bannon’s refusal to produce any documents or appear for his deposition.” The DC Circuit also rejected Bannon’s argument that the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection was improperly formed. “These objections suffer from a common defect,” the judges wrote. “Bannon did not raise them before the Select Committee and therefore forfeited them.” Bannon is one of two former members of Trump’s inner circle who faced prosecution for not participating in the House January 6 probe. The second, former Trump White House aidePeter Navarro, is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction. When the now-defunct House panel sought documents and testimony from Bannon in 2021, it pointed to alleged communications between Bannon and Trump in the days leading up to the January 6 Capitol attack, as well as comments Bannon made on his podcast the day before the riot that “all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.” Bannon for some time served in Trump’s White House, but by the time of Trump’s crusade to overturn his 2020 electoral loss, Bannon had long left the federal government.

63,Politics,"Rep. Henry Cuellar’s former campaign manager and another political operative have agreed to plead guilty to federal crimes and are cooperating withthe Justice Department’s prosecution of the Texas Democrat, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday. Mina Colin Strother, Cuellar’s former campaign manager and former chief of staff, and Florencio “Lencho” Rendon, a political consultant and Businessman from San Antonio, agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in March. Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, were indicted last week on suspicion of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities – a bank headquartered in Mexico City and an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan. Both the congressman and his wife have pleaded not guilty. Cuellar has publicly asserted his innocence, saying in a statement last week that “both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.” According to court documents, Rendon and Cuellar concocted the bribery scheme in 2015 after learning that the Mexican bank needed help doing Business within the United States. Rendon signed on to a phony “consulting agreement” with the bank for $15,000 per month, prosecutors say. Most of the money was eventually sent to the Cuellars, prosecutors allege, but Rendon didn’t think it was a good idea to send money directly to Imelda. Cuellar then suggested recruiting Strother as a middleman, prosecutors say. The alleged plot evolved into an arrangement where Rendon would send $11,000 per month to Strother, who in turn would send $10,000 to a company owned by Imelda Cuellar, according to court documents. From March 2016 to February 2018, Strother transferred nearly $215,000 to Cuellar’s wife, according to court filings. The Cuellars are not named in Strother’s and Rendon’s plea deal agreements, but both of their case numbers are listed as related cases to Cuellar’s in court records. Specific details laid out in the plea agreements also exactly match details in the indictment against Cuellar. Cuellar’s attorney, Chris Flood, told CNN in a statement, “As long as Strother and Rendon tell the truth, we are not worried. As we all know, the government can convince people to tell them what they want to hear rather than the truth. I don’t know what they are saying, but as long as they stick to the truth, we are not worried.” CNN has reached out to attorneys for Rendon and Strother for comment.

64,Politics,"Former PresidentDonald Trump’s lawyers continued their attack on the credibility of Stormy Daniels for several hours on Thursday, with defense attorney Susan Necheles accusing the adult film star of making up the story of having sex with Trump to make money. Daniels pushed back on claims she was untruthful about her sexual encounter with Trump, saying that the story was true, even as she was confronted with inconsistencies in some of the small details of her account. Related live-storyStormy Daniels wraps up testimony in Trump hush money trial “If that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better,” Daniels said of her encounter with Trump. One of Trump’s former White House aides later took the stand, testifying about the comings and goings in the West Wing and breaking down in tears about how she lost her job and her book that was highly positive toward the former president. At the end of the day, the proceedings heated back up as Trump’s attorneys argued, out of the presence of the jury, for a mistrial and to lift Trump from the gag order from speaking about Daniels. Judge Juan Merchan denied both motions. Here are the takeaways from Day 14 of the Trumphush money trial: Daniels returned to the witness stand Thursday morning for a second day of cross examination, in which she combatively and defiantly responded to questions from Necheles and insisted her story about her sexual encounter with Trump was true. Trump has denied the affair. Trump’s attorney asked about inconsistencies in interviews Daniels has given about how her dinner with Trump was arranged, whether they had dinner and the notion that she felt threatened by Trump during the encounter. She noted that Daniels saw men and women naked regularly through her work in adult film movies – questioning why then, allegedly seeing Trump on his bed in boxers and a T-shirt “was so upsetting that you got light-headed, the blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted?” “If I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn’t expecting to see there, yeah,” Daniels responded. Necheles also asked how she described the encounter,pointing to a prior interview in which she said Trump told her “come here” and they started kissing on the bed. He did say “come here,” Daniels said in response. “You made all this up, right?” Necheles said. “No,” Daniels responded. Necheles continued again with the insinuation turning to Daniels’ work as a writer of adult films. “You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real,” Necheles asked. Wow,” Daniels saidwith a pause. “That’s not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real just like what happened to me in that room.” Beyond the details of the alleged encounter itself, Trump’s attorneys and prosecutors had Daniels tell conflicting accounts of her financial situation. Necheles continued to suggest that Daniels was making money off of saying she had sex with Trump, pointing to a tweet where she said she’d earned $1 million and otherswhere she directed her supporters to her online store after Trump was indicted. “You’re celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store,” Necheles asked. “Not unlike Mr. Trump,” Daniels responded. Trump’s attorney also questioned Daniels about her “Make America Horny Again” strip club tour in 2018 – showing posters she had promoted – and about the money she made through an NBC documentary, in which the filmmakers paid for the rights to her book. During re-direct, prosecutors had Daniels recount how telling her story has also cost her, from having to move her daughter and hire security to the lawyers’ fees she was ordered to pay after she sued Trump and lost. “On balance has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump been net positive or net negative in your life?” “Negative,” Daniels said. Former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout described the inner-workings of Trump’s West Wing, where she worked for more than two years sitting just outside the Oval Office. Westerhout  was asked about a list of Trump’s contacts she received from his longtime Trump Organization assistant Rhona Graff – a list that included everyone from television news personalities like Joe Scarborough and Jeanine Pirro (who was at the courthouse Thursday) to sports legends Serena Williams and Tom Brady. Eventually working at a desk with a direct line of sight to the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Westerhout explained how she learned Trump’s work habits. Trump liked sharpies, for instance, and printouts of documents. He preferred the Oxford comma. And the former president, she said, “liked speaking to people in person or on the phone.” Asked how many people Trump would typically speak to in a day, she couldn’t cite a specific number. “A lot,” Westerhout said. He would take calls as early as 6 a.m. and “late into the night” after she had gone to bed, she testified. The prosecution walked Westerhout through the checks she would receive from the Trump Org. in New York, in which she described bringing Trump a manilla envelope of checks each month to sign. She then sent them back to New York. Westerhout did not testify to direct knowledge of the checks that Trump signed to his former fixer Michael Cohen, which are cited in the charges that Trump falsified Business records, but her story did add one more voice to the prosecution’s narrative that Trump was involved in signing of the checks in 2017. When asked to explain how she left the White House in 2019, Westerhout testified that she said some things she shouldn’t have and that she was “very regretful of my youthful indiscretion.” “I’ve grown a lot since then,” she said as she started crying. She was still sniffling as defense started cross examination, in which Necheles asked Westerhout about the book she wrote after leaving the White House, “Off the Record.” Westerhout said she “thought it was real important to share with the American people the man that I got to know.” “President Trump forgave you, right?” Necheles asked. “He did,” Westerhout said. “He was a really good boss.” Westerhout also offered jurors a contrast to Daniels’ account, testifying that Trump was close to his wife Melania and his family. The former president smiled as she described Melania Trump often texting her, “Madeline, it’s past dinner time. When is my husband coming home?” Trump’s lawyers asked Merchan both to declare a mistrial and modify the gag order against him after Daniels was off the stand. The judge rejected both requests. Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked for Trump to be allowed to publicly defend himself against Daniels’ allegations, arguing the former president currently is forced to stay silent in response to the suggestion that there was a non-consensual sexual encounter between her and Trump. Blanche argued that Daniels has changed her story by suggesting that this “completely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual.” Yet, Blanche said, “he is not allowed to say ‘I did not do that’” for voters who are seeing media coverage of the testimony. Merchan denied the request, saying he must protect the integrity of the proceedings and he doesn’t trust Trump not to violate an order if he were to modify it. “The reason why the gag order is in place to begin with is precisely because of the nature of these attacks, the vitriol,” Merchan said. “These were very real, very threatening attacks on potential witnesses.” “Your client’s track record speaks for itself here – I can’t take your word for it” that Trump will stick to disputing the facts, the judge also said. Merchan also denied Trump’s renewed motion for a mistrial over the salacious testimony Daniels gave that his attorneys say unfairly prejudices the jury against Trump. The judge said Trump’s outright denial of the incident and his legal team’s attack on her credibility opened the door for prosecutors to bring in Daniels’ testimony that turned salacious. “The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels’ story,” Merchan said. Merchan pointed the finger at Necheles who opted not to object to several salacious lines of questioning that the defense later used as reasons the judge should declare a mistrial. Blanche argued that Daniels’ testimony at trial was a new version of the alleged events – a point Merchan disagreed with. Prosecutor Josh Steinglass said Trump was aware of the “messy details” of the encounter in 2016 and that shows motive for the hush money payment and cover up. Blanche argued that the level of detail prosecutors elicited from Daniels went too far. But Merchan said “details like items in the bathroom, the weight of the furniture,” add a “sense of credibility if the jury chooses to believe them,” even as he acknowledged there were some details he would have preferred stayed out.

65,Politics,"President Joe Biden’sdecision this week to make publichis ultimatum that amajor Israeli offensivein the city of Rafah would result in a shut-off of some US weapons did not come easily or lightly. It came after multiple rounds of phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, starting in mid-February, urging him to reconsider his plans to invade the densely populated city in southern Gaza that has been a critical conduit for humanitarian aid. Hours and hours of virtual and in-person meetings between Biden’s top national security lieutenants and their Israeli counterparts were intended to send the same message, according to officials: There are other ways to go after Hamas, Biden’s aides laid out, that stop short of invading a city where more than a million Palestinians have gone to seek safety, officials said. At multiple levels, the president and his team warned Netanyahu that a major invasion of Rafah wouldn’t be aided by American weapons. It was a message the White House believed was well understood bythe government in Israel,White House officials said Thursday. Still, making those warnings publicwas a step Biden had long been wary of taking. Doing so would amount to a turning point, and the biggest break in US-Israel ties since the start of the war in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas. Even under pressure from progressives in his own party to take steps to limit humanitarian suffering in Gaza, Biden has been careful to avoid an open rift with Netanyahu. Still, in Netanyahu’s war cabinet meetings, a decision to go into Rafah appeared imminent. The Israel Defense Forces have now established a presence in Rafah and along its border, choking off two aid entry points and warning of a larger offensive to come. Ultimately, officials said, Biden came to believe his warnings were going unheeded and so he changed course. Last week, Biden signed off on a pause of 3,500 bombs to Israel that administration officials feared would be dropped on Rafah. And on Wednesday, sitting at a community college in Wisconsin for an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Biden made explicit to the world what he said he’d already made obvious to Netanyahu in private. “If they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities – that deal with that problem,” Biden told Burnett. The president’s aides said the message shouldn’t have been a surprise to their intended recipients in Israel. “I can assure you the direct and forthright nature with which he expressed himself and his concerns in that interview with Erin Burnett is consistent with how he has expressed himself to Prime Minister Netanyahu and to Israeli officials,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday. The Israeli government, Kirby said, “has understood … for some time now” the implications a major Rafah offensive would have on the future of American arms shipments. Aware or not of the president’s views, Israeli officials reacted with shock to the public announcement. Netanyahu was defiant. “If we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. I have said that, if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails,” he said Thursday. Israeli officials also sought to downplay the significance of Biden’s announcement. A spokesman for the IDF, Daniel Hagari, said Israel already has the weapons it needs for the missions it is planning. In addition to 2,000-pound bombs, Biden told CNN that artillery could be held up in the event of a Rafah invasion. Despite being smaller in size than the bombs, the Biden administration views artillery as indiscriminate and imprecise weapons that can exact a dangerous toll in urban areas. Israel has claimed its current campaign in Rafah is “limited,” a description US officials have echoed. But behind the scenes, doubts linger about Israel’s intentions, CNN has learned, with limited clarity provided to the US on how it plans to proceed. Throughout the course of the conflict, Biden’s frustration with Netanyahu has grown, even as the US president maintained publicly that his support for the state of Israel was unwavering. Biden has made clear that no matter what course the Israel-Hamas war takes, the US would remain Israel’s most stalwart ally so long as he is president. That conviction, advisers said, was separate and apart from the evolution of the president’s relationship with Netanyahu. “Israel is not the same thing as Netanyahu,” a senior Biden adviser told CNN. Rafah has hardly been the only irritant in the relationship. In the telling of Biden’s close advisers, the IDF’s accidental killing in early April of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza – one of them an American citizen – broke the president’s already strained patience. Upon learning the news, Biden expressed fury, advisers said. He made clear to advisers that he saw the deaths of the aid workers as an unacceptable “breakdown” in some of the most fundamental ways in which he expected Israel to conduct its war, and that the moment required a new response. His team quickly arranged a phone call with Netanyahu. Several weeks prior, Biden had shared with friends on Capitol Hill – in comments that were caught on a hot mic – that he and the prime minister were likely headed towards some kind of rupture. He predicted the two leaders were due for a “come to Jesus” moment. Multiple advisers did not deny that Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu in April was, at the very least, as close to such a “come to Jesus” moment as the two leaders had had up until that point. In the brief call, Biden issued a new warning to Netanyahu: If Israel did not course-correct, the US would reconsider how it supports its ally in the conflict. It marked the clearest signal yet that six months into the war, Biden was starting to seriously consider conditioning US support for Israel. But even then, it was not known what exactly those consequences might look like, and what actions from Israel would ultimately push Biden over the edge. Since their call, the White House has praised Israel for taking steps to increase humanitarian aid, including opening additional crossings. Yet Rafah continued to shadow the relationship, as Israeli officials insisted on the necessity of going after Hamas in the city, even as Biden aides said they hadn’t seen a plan to protect civilians there. Meetings between the two sides failed to yield consensus on the issue, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials were unconvinced by Israel’s plans to protect civilians and made clear in public statements that an invasion of the city would amount to a humanitarian disaster. “The president and his team have been clear for several weeks that we do not support a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering with nowhere safe to go,” Kirby said on Thursday. “The president has said that publicly and he has communicated that repeatedly and straightforwardly to Prime Minister Netanyahu.” After Biden’s CNN interview, officials stressed the White House position on conditioning aid is a hypothetical one: The US would only pare back the equipment and weaponry provided to its longstanding ally if it launches the invasion of Rafah. That didn’t stop the president’s critics from accusing him of renouncing Israel, despite his clear statement that he wasn’t “walking away from Israel’s security.” Across the GOP spectrum, from former President Donald Trump to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, Biden’s political opponents likened the announcement to a message of an abandonment amid an ongoing war with terrorists. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who’d just survivedan ouster attempt, even suggested in an interview with Politico that Biden had a “senior moment” when he made the remark. Some Democrats also voiced criticism. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a staunch supporter of Israel, said that he disagreed with Biden’s plan to withhold some weapons shipments to Israel, warning the move “demonstrates to Hamas that they’re winning the PR war.” “I am concerned about that, and I don’t agree with the president,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. Sen. Jon Tester, a vulnerable Democrat from Montana, said, “I think he should release it” when asked about Biden’s handling of the weapons shipments. And Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said he was planning to speak with administration officials about the details of their plan later Thursday. “I’m trying to find out legally what they’re doing and the reasons for it,” he said. “So, until I’ve had a chance to talk to the administration, I’m going to defer making any specific comments.” Even though the president’s position amounted to his toughest public stance on Israel since the start of the war, it also appeared to do little to satisfy those in his own party who have agitated for an end to US support. “I think it’s a good step forward. I think we’ve got to do even more,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont democratic socialist, said on CNN, adding Biden’s warning about conditioning weapons “should have come a lot earlier.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/Politics/inside-bidens-public-ultimatum/index.html,CNN,Inside Biden’s decision to go public with his ultimatum to Israel over Rafah,,0
66,Politics,"Jack Quinn, former White House counsel and powerhouse Washington, DC, lawyer and influencer, passed away Wednesday at the age of 74. That is the obituary headline of a man who used his wonderful life to make a difference in American Politics and public policy. A New York-born son of a power plant manager and a homemaker who was the first in his family to go to college, Quinn was ambitious and service-minded from the start. It was at the prestigious Georgetown University law school where Quinn got the political bug that led him to Capitol Hill, campaigns and eventually to the White House asPresident Bill Clinton’s counsel during the turbulent years of theWhitewater investigation. The powerbroker and top lobbyist in more recent years used his experience and know-how to represent family members of those killed in theSeptember 11, 2001, attacksinlawsuits alleging Saudi Arabia’s culpability. But the man I had the privilege of knowing was so much more. Outside of all that, I knew him as a friend; a husband who loved my dear friend Susanna, his wife of 17 years, with all of his heart; and a father who adored his eight children and 12 grandchildren. John Michael Quinn - “Jack” - was the kind of person who would send a text of encouragement out of the blue, greet you with his giant smile and a twinkle in his eye no matter how he was feeling and was always eager to show love and affection to his large family and friends. Looking back today at my texts from Jack, it was not uncommon to see “I love you” from him in the thread. But he was also someone who showed extreme kindness to people he barely knew. Jack was a CNN legal analyst for several years during the Trump administration, sharing his insights and vast expertise with our viewers on a regular basis. Elie Honig, now a senior CNN legal analyst, told me that he remembers being very new to television and meeting Jack in the green room. “I, of course, knew who Jack was, but he’d have no reason to know me aside from my first handful of on-air appearances. I hadn’t even met him in person yet, and he went to the effort of getting my email address and sending me a note welcoming me and saying I was doing a great job. I’ll always remember that gesture,” he told me, while noting that Jack was always “sunny” even when his health issues became more challenging. Those health issues, a lung disease that eventually took his life, made his CNN appearances harder and harder. But his impact is indelible. One of our talented makeup artists remarked to me when learning of Jack’s passing how kind and solicitous he always was - no matter the time or the circumstance, which is not always the case in the stressful and unpredictable world of cable news. Jack’s youngest son, Storm, and my son are about a year apart and became friends as babies. Watching Jack interact with his miracle boy was something to behold – the amount of love knew no bounds – nevermind that his DNA is so strong that Storm, much like Jack’s other children, resembles him so much that it was almost eerie. The mark that Jack made on this world is far greater than his titles, far deeper than his jobs and far more impressive than his political influence. He was a man of character, compassion and good humor, and I am one of countless people who feel blessed to have had him in my life. May his memory be a blessing.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/Politics/jack-quinn-died-white-house-counsel/index.html,CNN,"Remembering Jack Quinn, former White House counsel but more importantly a good man",,0

The bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill would renew authority for the agency for the next five years and aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. The House will next need to pass the legislation. The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislationseeks to addressthe nation’s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring, includes strengthened consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays, and would implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions. Although there is broad bipartisan support for the legislation, the package touched off contentious debate over some of its provisions. One flashpoint centered aroundflights at Reagan National Airportjust outside of Washington, DC – with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package. Ultimately, however, there were no votes on amendments. Some lawmakers argue that adding flights will give consumers more choices and bring down prices, while others say it would increase congestion and delays at the airport. The House voted on Wednesday to pass a one-week extension for federal aviation programs, a stopgap move intended to head off alooming end-of-week deadline.Congress is up against a Friday deadline to reauthorize FAA authorities. This will move that deadline to next Friday, May 17.

68,Politics,"Judge Juan Merchan called out former President Donald Trump’s defense team during their motion for a mistrial Thursday afternoon, telling them there were many times they could have objected to Stormy Daniels’ testimony, but did not. For the second time this week, Merchan expressed surprise that Trump’s lawyers had not objected more when Daniels was on the stand. And for the second time this week, Merchan rejected their motion for a mistrial. Trump attorney Todd Blanche argued Daniels’ changed her story by suggesting that this “completely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual” and said the defense did not know those questions were coming, hearing them for the first time on Tuesday. The judge responded to their arguments saying, “For some unexplained reason that I still don’t understand” there was no objection to certain testimony cited in the motion for a mistrial and again today. Merchan specifically pointed to Daniels’ testimony about the trailer park, in which Daniels suggested Trump told her she would be stuck living in a trailer park before they had sex in 2006. The judge said he felt that was unnecessary and he objected himself. Another example listed by Merchan was the testimony about Trump not wearing a condom. Merchan said he was surprised attorney Susan Necheles did not object. “Why on earth she (Necheles) wouldn’t object to the mention of a condom I don’t understand,” Merchan said. Daniels testified on Tuesday that Trump did not wear a condom when they had sex and described telling Trump during their conversation at the hotel dining room table her sexual partners during filming of her movies always wore a condom. Merchan also referred back to the defense’s opening statement when Blanche denied there was ever a sexual encounter between Daniels and Trump. The judge said that assertion opened the door for the prosecution to make an effort to show her story was credible to prove their case, allowing them to ask more detailed questions about the encounter. “The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels’ story,” Merchan said.

69,Politics,"US intelligence officials are watching closely to see if theUnited States’ support for Ukrainewill lead the Russian government to take more risks in potentially interfering in the 2024 presidential election, a senior FBI official told reporters Thursday. FBI officials are concerned that thewar in Ukraine– andPresident Joe Biden’s reliable backing of Kyiv – might be an “animating event for the Russians,” the FBI official said at a briefing with reporters about election security efforts. “We’re certainly… keeping our eye out to make sure that that’s not increasing [their] risk taking.” The FBI briefed reporters on the condition that the senior FBI officials not be named. Related articleRussia sees window of opportunity to expand attacks as Ukraine awaits further US aid, officials say A clear divide has emerged in US Politics, with Democrats largely backing Biden’s financial and military support for Ukraine, and some leading Republicans, includingformer President Donald Trumpandcongressional GOP hardliners, increasingly backing away from the foreign aid. US officials are concerned that, withUS military aid to Ukrainepotentially on the line in the November election, Russia could be motivated to more aggressively meddle in the 2024 election than it did in 2020. But US officials have not publicly identified any examples of that happening yet. In the 2020 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to denigrate Biden, support Trump and undermine confidence in the US electoral process, according to a declassifiedUS intelligence report. But Russia’s actions in 2020 weren’t as brazen or far-reaching as itshack-and-leak operationsto help Trump and undermine Hillary Clinton’s candidacy in 2016, according to US intelligence agencies. The FBI official’s comments on Thursday echo those made by a senior National Security Agency official in March. “I think where we diverge in this election cycle is Russia is very motivated to make sure that that the focus on support to Ukraine is disrupted,” Rob Joyce, who headed NSA’s Cybersecurity Directorate before retiring in late March, told reporters. “I think you’ll see the themes of their activities all pushed through a lens of what is going to erode support for Ukraine.” Asked by CNN if that makes Russia more likely to interfere in the 2024 US elections compared to 2020, Joyce said: “I don’t know that it makes them more likely, but it does make them dangerous.” During Thursday’s FBI press briefing, a second senior FBI official said that Russia likely viewsUS election infrastructure, including state and local government networks, as “legitimate targets” for cyber-espionage and data collection. “Russia can use their access to those government networks to undermine confidence in the US election integrity and bolster influence operations,” the second FBI official said. The FBI officials also singled out China and Iran as other governments that could be willing to interfere in or influence the 2024 US election. In the 2020 election, Chinaconsideredconducting influence operations aimed at changing the outcome of the election but chose not to, according to theUS intelligence report. Iran, meanwhile, conducted a “multipronged covert influence campaign” aimed at hurting Trump’s election bid, the report said. Artificial intelligence, the first FBI official said, increases the ability of sophisticated state actors “to scale their operations and … really build them out larger than we’ve seen previously.” CNN’s Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/Politics/fbi-concern-ukraine-russia-2024-election/index.html,CNN,FBI watching if US support for Ukraine will spur Russian risk taking in 2024 election,,0
70,Politics,"Desperately needed humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza will at least for the next few days remain sitting off the coast of Gaza on an American Navy cargo ship, as the US continues to face obstacles to getting thefloating pier it has constructedin place and operational in the eastern Mediterranean. The pier and causeway, known as Joint Logistics Over the Shore or JLOTS, will ultimately be used by the US, its allies and aid groups to get aid into Gaza by sea from Cyprus. But the system had to be moved to the Port of Ashdod last week due to heavy seas, and it still hasn’t left. Even when JLOTS becomes operational, the weather and sea conditions may severely limit the ability to use the floating pier. It can only be safely operated in conditions with a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour, according to a 2006 Naval War College paper on the systems limitations. A prediction of sea conditions fromIsrael’s Marine Data Centershows waves are often at or near that 3-foot limit in the area. “JLOTS operations, which must take both safety and throughput requirements into account, must often wait for favorable weather and sea state conditions,” the authors wrote. A defense official confirmed to CNN that the limitations on the pier system are accurate. “The bottom line – heavy seas do have an effect on the ability to execute the JLOTS mission,” the official said. If winds or waves are stronger, loading and unloading using the JLOTS pier becomes dangerous. Another potentially complicating factor is how Israel decides to proceed with its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza, US officials said. A major Israeli offensive there could raise additional security concerns and impact the timing of when the pier and causeway are staged in the eastern Mediterranean. The planned staging area for the aid once it reaches Gaza has been hit by mortar and rocket fire at least twice in the last several weeks, CNN has reported. The US is still aiming to move the system into place and begin the operation “in the coming days,” a Pentagon spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. For now, a massive barge called the M/V Sagamore that will be used to deliver the initial pallets of humanitarian aid from Cyprus to the pier has begun to move the supplies to another ship currently off the coast of Gaza, called the M/V Roy P. Benavidez. The Benavidez, contracted by the US military, has been in the eastern Mediterranean since last month supporting the maritime corridor effort. The US is also still working to finalize plans about who will actually transport humanitarian aid from the pier to the shore in Gaza, according to multiple US officials familiar with the matter. The UK had initially offered to provide personnel to help drive aid trucks from the US military-built causeway off the coast of Gaza to the shore, where it would be picked up by UN personnel overseen by the World Food Programme, officials said. But the British recently withdrew that offer amid security concerns, the sources said. The US, meanwhile, has ruled out using its own troops to drive the aid to the beach, because the Biden administration does not want American personnel getting that close to Gaza, officials have said. A UK government spokesperson said that the UK does not “currently have plans to deploy Armed Forces personnel onto Gazan soil as part of this initiative, but we are working closely with the US, Cyprus, and other allies to ensure aid can be quickly delivered over the pier once it is fully installed.” Another diplomatic source familiar with the discussions confirmed that there had been conversations in which the UK had offered to drive the aid down the causeway to the pier, as part of “a host of contingency plans” that had been developed. “But for now there are no plans for the UK to be involved in that way,” the source added “The most likely scenario is an as yet undecided third party.” Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday that “non-US civilian contractors will be driving those vehicles on the causeway onto the beach.” One plan being discussed is for Israeli contractors to transport the aid, the officials and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. But that could also change and is not finalized, despite the Pentagon predicting that the pier will be up and running in the next several days. The Israel Defense Forces have agreed to provide a wide security perimeter around the pier system and the aid operation. That has made some humanitarian groups and UN officials uneasy given the IDF’s history of targeting aid convoys and the perception that they are working under the IDF’s control, CNN previously reported. But the plan is for the IDF to remain at a relative distance as the aid is transported and offloaded onto the beach in Gaza, officials told CNN.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/Politics/us-gaza-pier-obstacles/index.html,CNN,US facing obstacles getting aid delivered to Gaza after finishing pier construction,,0
71,Politics,"Hunter Biden’s latest attempts to throw out his federal gun case were rejected in back-to-back rulings Thursday, teeing up a high-stakes criminal trial next month in Delaware. The president’s son had asked the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss the charges by overturningprior decisionsfrom the trial judge that let the case move forward. But the appellate panel instead rejected Hunter Biden’s appeals, which related to his defunct plea deal and his claims that the case was tainted by political bias. Hours later, the trial judge, Maryellen Noreika, rejected Hunter Biden’s remaining motion to dismiss the case based on Second Amendment grounds. The rulings pave the way for the first-ever trial against the child of a sitting US president. They’re also a victory for special counsel David Weiss, who is prosecuting Hunter Biden in two separate criminal cases and is fending off aggressive pushback from his lawyers. With the gun case intact, Hunter Biden now faces a legally and politically perilous summer, with back-to-back trials while his father focuses on the 2024 campaign. The gun trial is slated to begin in early June unless the parties reach a plea deal or some other agreement to resolve the case, which is always possible. A separate tax trial is scheduled to begin in late June. “In reviewing the panel’s decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,” Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement about the appeals court ruling, suggesting that he may ask the full Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit to rehear the appeal. Prosecutors claim Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, whichviolated federal lawbecause he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts. His attorneys have argued that the charges trample his Second Amendment rights and that “possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety.” Noreika, a Trump appointee who was confirmed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate, refused to dismiss the gun indictment last month. She also previously presided over Hunter Biden’sbotched plea deal hearinglast summer. Hunter Biden is also facing afederal tax indictment, and that trial is slated to begin in late June in California. He has pleaded not guilty to all nine charges in that case, which revolves around millions of dollars he made in Ukraine, in China and through other overseas deals. Weiss’ team successfully argued that the appellate court didn’t have jurisdiction to review whether Noreika made any mistakes earlier this year while rejecting Hunter Biden’s motions to dismiss the gun case. “This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court’s orders are appealable before final judgment,” the three-judge appellate panel wrote in a four-page ruling. They turned away his attempts to review lower-court decisions about the legality of Weiss’ appointment and whether last year’s botched plea deal – which would’ve resolved the case – was still active. In rejecting his appeal Thursday, the 3rd Circuit panel said those types of deals with prosecutors “do not implicate a right not to be tried” and wouldn’t give Hunter Biden additional avenues to pursue appeals. The decision was unanimous and based on procedural grounds. The three-judge panel included one Republican appointee and two Democratic appointees, including Judge Cindy Chung, who was put on the bench by President Joe Biden. Further, the ruling could make it harder for Hunter Biden to appeal his loss in the Second Amendment challenge, which Noreika rejected Thursday. Hunter Biden’s attorneys argued the three gun charges should be tossed out because the firearm-possession statute used against him violated the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. The specific statutes involved in the case make it a crime to lie on federal firearm forms about using illicit drugs, and also make it illegal to own a gun while using those drugs. Hunter Biden’s attorneys, citing arecent decision from the 5th Circuit– which does not cover the state of Delaware, where he was charged – argued that under the Second Amendment, an individual “can no longer be denied gun ownership due simply to past drug use.” But the trial judge disagreed in her ruling Thursday. “The current state of the law on the facial constitutionality of (the statute) is decidedly not in Defendant’s favor,” Noreika wrote. “No appellate court has agreed with his position, and possibly only one district court has found (the statute) unconstitutional on its face. This Court ultimately sides with the great majority of cases upholding the facial constitutionality of (the statute).” In the 5th Circuit case, US v. Daniels, the conservative-leaning appeals court said the federal gun law that prohibits users of illegal drugs from possessing firearms was unconstitutional. In reaching that conclusion, the appeals court cited a landmark 2022 Supreme Court decision thatchanges the framework that lower courts must usewhen analyzing gun restrictions. Prosecutors handling Hunter Biden’s case have called the 5th Circuit decision “mistaken.” They also noted Hunter Biden’s own admission to using illicit drugs while he allegedly purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018. Noreika on Thursday also rejected an attempt by Hunter Biden to obtain internal Justice Department documents that could shed light on any attempts by former President Donald Trump and his appointees to interfere with the long-running criminal investigation. As part of an effort to find evidence that Hunter Biden was being politically targeted, his attorneys asked for any documents about him that involved Trump, former Attorney General Bill Barr, other top Justice Department officials or several US attorneys. But the judge turned down that request Thursday. Shepreviously rebuffedHunter Biden’s bid to throw out the case because of the supposed politicization, noting that even though Trump did call for Hunter Biden’s prosecution while he was president, the charges were filed under President Joe Biden’s watch and with oversight from Biden’s appointees. “Defendant has failed to show how any of the requested communications among former DOJ and Executive Branch officials could constitute exculpatory evidence as applied to him and the three firearm-related offenses being pursued here,” Noreika wrote Thursday.

The Chilean defeated the world No. 1 and top seed 6-2 6-3 in the third round of the Italian Open on Sunday in what was the first meeting between the pair. “It’s incredible. I came on court just looking around and soaking it all in, trying to process everything. I’m trying to wake up right now,” said Tabilo, 26, per the ATP. Djokovic, a six-time champion in Rome, was broken four times by the world No. 32 and has yet to win a title this year. His five double faults were particularly costly. “I was just trying to keep my nerves in, trying to keep swinging,” added Tabilo. “Obviously every time you feel like you are closer to the end, your arms start to get a little tighter and you start to swing shorter, so I was just trying to not think about it and take it point by point. It’s crazy, I can’t believe what just happened.” After losing the first set, Djokovic served up two double faults in the opening game of the second set to gift his opponent a crucial advantage. It was another Djokovic double fault which gave Tabilo his fourth break of the match to secure an incredible victory. Djokovic was accidentallyhit on the head with a water bottlefollowing his second-round win on Friday. He told reporters he “didn’t know” if that incident had impacted his performance. “Training was different,” he said, according to the ATP. “I didn’t feel anything, but I also didn’t feel the same. “Today (Sunday) under high stress, it was quite bad – not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance.

The scores remained level for almost the entire first half before Ella Toone gave United the lead with a dazzling goal on the stroke of half-time, and Spurs collapsed in the second half to derail any hope of a comeback. “We are history makers for Manchester United,” the club’s manager Marc Skinner told the BBC. “I didn’t need to remind the owners of that, they know. There is a lot of support and love for our team and the growth. “We want to compete for titles but you all know how important adding that first piece of silverware is. We’ve got nothing but growth ahead.” Sunshine poured down onto the pitch, creating temperatures so hot that there was a drinks break in each half, and it remained even in the early exchanges, both sides not quite able to break down the other’s defense. It seemed that the half would end goalless, that is until Toone created a little magic in its final moments. She evaded Eveliina Summanen’s challenge, wrongfooting and swerving past her, before unleashing a powerful strike from outside the box that curled into the top right-hand corner of the net, past Becky Spencer’s outstretched fingertips. United doubled its lead shortly after halftime, when Rachel Williams rose highest for Katie Zelem’s perfectly weighted free-kick and headed the ball into the net, as she had been threatening to do all game. And the club’s victory was all but confirmed two minutes later as a Tottenham defensive lapse gifted United a third goal when Spencer, attempting to clear the ball, simply passed it to Lucía García who tapped it in for a 3-0 lead.

74,Sports,"When Lauren Price was eight years old, she wrote down three goals for herself – to become a kickboxing world champion, play internationalsoccerfor Wales and compete at anOlympic Games. For most people, growing up involves making choices, giving up on multiple dreams to concentrate all their energies on a single one, in the hope that perhaps just one, if they are lucky, can be realized. But Lauren Price never had to make that decision. At 12, she was a world kickboxing champion, a title she won another three times. Before she turned 18, she had already played soccer for Wales twice at senior level and another 50 times at under-16, under-17 and under-19 levels, where she captained her team. Soccer and kickboxing were ticked off the list. Then, watching female boxers fight in an Olympic ring for the first time at London 2012 inspired yet another goal for Price, and she took up the sport shortly afterwards, leaving soccer to focus on it. That was the sport that took her to the Olympic Games where, remarkably, she won a gold medal at Tokyo 2020 in the female middleweight division. And, on Saturday, she completed yet another milestone when she became Wales’ first female world champion boxer as she defeated Jessica McCaskill by a unanimous technical decision after the fight in Cardiff, Wales was stopped early on medical advice to treat McCaskill’s injured, swollen eye. “This is just the start,” Price, now the WBA, IBO and Ring Magazine welterweight champion, told broadcaster Sky Sports afterwards. “I want to build a legacy and create greatness … You see what Katie Taylor did for Ireland, I want to do the same for Wales.” But, despite the seemingly seamless realization of all her childhood dreams, Price had to fight hard for them outside the ring as well as inside. When she initially began boxing, Price juggled training with work as a teaching assistant, providing support to a girl with special educational needs, and later as a taxi driver for her grandparents’ company, driving people to and from Cardiff on Friday and Saturday nights. Her grandparents, Linda and Derek, brought her up from the age of three days old. They were the ones to first introduce Price to sport, initially as a way to provide an outlet for all her energy as a child, Linda told The National Lottery, which provides funding to British athletes, in 2021. “They always supported me and told me to believe in my dreams. My nan used to say ‘reach for the moon, if you fall short you’ll land on the stars,’” Price told Sky Sports. “Even now she got me a good luck card and I’ll read that before fight night, it’s just the little things.” Price’s grandfather, Derek, passed away in November 2020, before he could watch her become an Olympic champion and turn into the new boxing “superstar,” as Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom said, per the BBC. “I believe that if you work hard enough and you have got dreams, then you can achieve them,” Price told Sky Sports on Saturday before her world title fight. “I was a kid once and I had three things … I managed to tick all three of them with the love and support of my grandparents.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/lauren-price-world-champion-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,The new boxing ‘superstar’ who played international soccer and juggled training with driving taxis,,1
75,Sports,"Lionel Messiappeared to cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines when a newMajor League Soccerrule prevented him from immediately returning to the pitch following an injury check. With Inter Miami 2-0 down against Montréal on Saturday, Messi was off the pitch when his team needed someone to take a free-kick. The Argentine had received on-field treatment moments earlier in the first half following a tackle from defender George Campbell, which had led to the free-kick being awarded, and then walked off the pitch. The situation brought the MLS’ “Off-Field Treatment Rule,” introduced in April, into play. According to the rules: “If a player with a suspected injury remains on the ground for more than 15 seconds, the referee will stop play and wave the medical crew onto the field to evaluate the player. “When safe, the player will be removed from the field and remain off the field for a minimum of two minutes for further assessment and treatment.” Unable to return to the pitch, Messi turned towards a television camera on the sidelines, shook his head and said in Spanish: “With these type of rules …” The moment has been widely shared on social media. The 36-year-old was not missed during the free kick, however, as Matías Rojas took it and scored in the top-right corner to reduce the deficit to 2-1, sparking a comeback. Miami eventually celebrated a 3-2 victory, the team’s fifth consecutive league win which extends its unbeaten run to seven games. Luis Suárez and Benjamin Cremaschi were the other scorers on a night when Messi did not find the net. After the match, Miami coach Gerardo Martino told reporters that there were rules that “must be revised.” According to the rule book, the two-minute rule would not have taken effect had Campbell received a yellow or red card for the foul on Messi. “Exceptions to the Off-Field Treatment Rule include instances of potential head injury, goalkeeper injuries, serious medical events, and fouls resulting in yellow or red cards,” the rule states. “In Leo’s situation, he was clearly fouled,” Martino said, per ESPN. “The player deserved a yellow card, which would mean Messi would’ve never left the field for two minutes. “As I understand it, the team that suffered the foul was punished. With these new rule changes, there are situations that must be revised. The infraction was clear and was a yellow card, and ultimately it was us that lost Leo for two minutes.” CNN has contacted the MLS for comment.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/lionel-messi-mls-rule-change-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,Lionel Messi appears unhappy with new MLS rule as he is forced to wait on sidelines before returning to the pitch,,1
76,Sports,"On May 12, the CNN series “How it Really Happened” will explore the life ofOscar Pistorius,the double-amputee Paralympic and Olympic sprinter who was convicted in the murder of his girlfriend, South African model Reeva Steenkamp, more than a decade ago. Known as the “Blade Runner” for his carbon-fiber prosthetics, Pistorius was once heralded as an inspirational figure At the 2012 London Games, he became the first Paralympian to compete at an Olympics and during his successful track career won eight Paralympic medals, six of them gold. He was in his athletic prime when, on February 14, 2013, he killed Steenkamp. “If you take the celebrity of LeBron James and you combined it with the appeal of Leonardo DiCaprio, that was what Oscar Pistorius was,” said Scott Roder, a crime scene reconstruction expert who worked on the case, in CNN’s documentary, hosted by Jesse L. Martin. The documentary features footage from the court in Pretoria, South Africa, during Pistorius’s 2013 murder trial and 2023 parole hearing and original interviews with Steenkamp’s mother, modeling agent and family attorney. Pistorius shot Steenkamp four times through the bathroom door of his house. In a trial that garnered global attention, he denied killing her in a fit of anger and instead said he had mistaken her for an intruder. He pleaded not guilty to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp’s killing. He was initially convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison before that conviction was overturned and upgraded to murder, increasing his sentence to six years. In 2017, his sentence was increased to 13 years and five months by South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal. The documentary examines the details leading to Steenkamp’s murder – including disagreements between the couple shared over WhatsApp and the athlete’s “obsession” with firearms, though his motives remain unknown to this day. “Why would he kill her? Why did he do it?” Steenkamp’s mother, June, asked in the documentary. She called Pistorius’ version of events “absolute rubbish and lies” and spoke candidly about the pain she felt on that night in 2013. She recalled the moment she was told that her daughter had died, describing it as “the worst day of my life.” “I was hysterical,” she said. “I just wanted to die myself, honestly. I didn’t want to live without her.” The documentary sheds light on the whirlwind romance between the couple and the life of Steenkamp, described by her mother as “a blessing, a gift from God. Very clever, and she was always laughing.” “She would have done amazing things,” said Tania Koen, CEO of the Reeva Steenkamp Foundation. “And she was so kind and passionate and compassionate. The world was a better place with Reeva in it.” Pistorius, now 37 years old, wasreleased on paroleon January 5 this year. A parole board granted his petition in November on the grounds that he had served half of his 13-year sentence for murdering Steenkamp, making him eligible according to South African law. He has kept a low profile since his release, but the conditions of his parole include restrictions on his movements, mandatory classes on gender-based violence, anger management therapy, no alcohol and he’s not allowed to speak to the media. Steenkamp’s mother has been vocal in her criticism of his release and expressed her concern for the safety of other women. “At this time, I am not convinced that Oscar has been rehabilitated,”she saidin a victim impact statement in November 2023. “Rehabilitation requires someone to engage honestly with the full truth of his crime and the consequences thereof. Nobody can claim to have remorse if they are not able to engage fully with the truth. “If someone does not show remorse, they cannot be considered to be rehabilitated. If they are not rehabilitated, their risk of recidivism is high.” “Oscar Pistorius: The Bladerunner” airs on CNN on Sunday, May 12 at 9 p.m. ET/PT",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/oscar-pistorius-cnn-documentary-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,"With Oscar Pistorius released on parole after serving nine years for murdering Reeva Steenkamp, her family still want answers",,1
77,Sports,"Like any competitive swimmer, Meghan Cortez-Fields knows how high the stakes can be in a sport where mere hundredths of a second can mean the difference between victory and defeat. But she is among the few who have feared what victory may bring. “I was afraid that if I was able to win, all of my success would be discredited because I was trans,” Cortez-Fields, a senior on the women’s swim team at New Jersey’s Ramapo College, told CNN. As an NCAA competitor, Cortez-Fields underwent more than a year of hormone therapy, blood tests and testosterone tracking to meet the association’s transgender athlete guidelines and achieve her dream of swimming alongside other women. In recent weeks, however, the NCAA has faced a flood of calls to further restrict the participation of trans students after a much smaller athletics association, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), voted toeffectively bantrans women from competing in most of its women’s sports programs. Last month, the NCAA announcedits policyis “under review.” Marshi Smith, the co-founder of the Independent Council on Women’s Sports (ICONS), which fights against trans women’s participation in women’s sports, applauded the NAIA’s ban as a “crucial measure” and called on the NCAA to “release a policy that protects the women’s category.” Critics like Smith argue that transgender women – even those who have undergone treatment to lower their testosterone levels – have unfair physical advantages that would deprive cisgender women of opportunities to succeed. But transgender athletes and their advocates point to a lack of consistent, direct research to support this claim. They say trans women deserve the right to compete alongside their peers. “The idea that trans women are taking over women’s sport is a pretty outside statement given the number of trans women who are competing in the NCAA,” said Anna Baeth, director of research at Athlete Ally, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ equality in sports. Baeth estimates fewer than 40 of the NCAA’s more than 500,000 athletes are known to be transgender. Last month, Athlete Ally sent the NCAA letters signed by more than 400 current and former professional and collegiate athletes, as well as hundreds of researchers and advocacy groups, imploring the organization to continue allowing transgender athletes to compete. “To deny transgender athletes the fundamental right to be who they are, to access the sport they love, and to receive the proven mental and physical health benefits of sport goes against the very principles of the NCAA’s Constitution,” readthe lettersigned by athletes including retired US women’s national soccer team star Megan Rapinoe. “Every single student should have access to the lifesaving power of sports.” Competitive swimming pools have become a battleground in the fight over transgender athletes’ exclusion, exploding into focus when University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas became the first transgender athlete towin an NCAA Division I titlein 2022. Smith, the ICONS co-founder, said watching Thomas compete “was really devastating.” “It’s unfair,” she said. “I felt like I was witnessing women shriveling up.” The NCAA’s policy was revised in 2022 to align “transgender student-athlete participation with the Olympic Movement.” The association takes a sport-by-sport approach, which allows trans players to participate if they have undergone one year of testosterone suppression treatment and meet the testosterone level required by their sport’s national or international governing body. Trans women athletes, including Cortez-Fields, say competing alongside other women is a crucial step toward feeling like their authentic selves and can help combat feelings of isolation. “Trans people have existed since the beginning of time. But we win and it becomes an issue,” she said. For Cortez-Fields, plunging into the muffled echo of the water has always felt like a sacred moment. But that embracing environment became increasingly fraught as she began to express her trans identity during her second season on the men’s team. “Wearing a men’s suit, having to tape my breasts, even just competing against men – it starts to hurt more because it feels like a part of you is dying and wilting away,” she said. “I believed I needed to sacrifice being trans in order to swim.” Cortez-Fields spent more than a year undergoing hormone therapy, meticulously tracking her testosterone levels and trying to train even as her body no longer allowed her to glide through the water with the speed and stamina she once did. Finally, in her senior year, she was cleared by the NCAA to compete on the women’s team, which Cortez-Fields said at the time was “one of the most exciting things that’s ever happened.” She recalls her final meet in February as “one of the best meets of my entire life.” “Every single moment was just magical,” she said. “I just felt like I was literally flying to the water.” During the meet, Cortez-Fields broke two school records and placed 2nd in the 100-yard butterfly – successes she says were scrutinized by anti-trans groups and conservative news outlets but widely celebrated by her teammates. “The majority of the women I have met and swim against, they have celebrated me. They make me feel like I deserve to be there, and I should fight for my place there,” she said. The debate is complicated by a lack of significant research – and scientific consensus – on whether trans athletes, particularly trans women, have an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, even after they have undergone testosterone-reducing therapies. Dr. Joshua Safer, executive director of the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, said many elite sports associations are trying to craft policies without meaningful data on how trans athletes perform in their specific categories, such as soccer or basketball. “If you’re trying to be ‘fair’ – however fair is defined – then you need to look at individual athletic activities directly,” Safer said. “It would be a matter of taking transgender people who participate in sports and looking at them before and after some of their treatments and really measuring differences, especially in common sports.” Such studies may be especially difficult to perform given the relatively small number of trans athletes known to be competing at elite levels. Though research is ongoing, a 2017 review in the journal Sports Medicine found “no direct or consistent research” showing trans people have an advantage. A more recent October 2023reviewconcluded that sex differences do develop following puberty, but many are “reduced, if not erased, over time by gender affirming hormone therapy.”  Qualities such as height and limb length appear to be “less malleable,” the study said, though it pointed out that there are no efforts to restrict cisgender athletes who are exceptionally gifted physically. Until more data is available, Safer believes governing bodies like the NCAA should be wary of enacting sweeping restrictions so that “we don’t get ahead of ourselves.” “Associations should err on the side of being cautious and inclusive until data indicates that there may be an advantage, and then they can make adjustments,” he said. In the absence of a scientific consensus, both sides have argued their case by invoking Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. Trans advocacy organizations remain hopeful that President Joe Biden’s administration will follow through on itsproposal last yearto revise Title IX to bar schools from enacting bans on transgender athletes. “Title IX is really the only major legislation at the federal level that protects cisgender women athletes, and we do believe that should apply to trans athletes,” said Baeth with Athlete Ally. “We want Title IX to consider gender, not just sex assigned at birth.” Any direct mention of trans athletes was notably missing, however, from the Biden administration’s changes to Title IX last month, whichexpanded protectionsfor LGBTQ students. Before the new changes were announced, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that the process of reviewing the trans sports protections is “ongoing.” But some cisgender athletes and conservative lawmakers see the inclusion of trans women in women’s sports as a striking violation of Title IX’s nondiscrimination rule. In March,more than a dozencurrent and former collegiate female athletes sued the NCAA over its transgender participation policy and accused the organization of a “radical departure from Title IX’s original meaning” by allowing trans women to compete against cisgender women. Their outcry was echoed last month by more than a dozen Republican lawmakers who wrote ina letterto NCAA president Charlie Baker that they believe transgender women’s participation will deprive cisgender women “of a fair opportunity to compete and achieve athletic success.” Republican lawmakers at the state and local level have largely driven the push to bar trans people from competing in sports aligning with their gender identity, and their efforts have not been confined to elite competition. Restrictions against trans players have spread across Little League baseball diamonds, high school soccer fields and into the halls of state legislatures nationwide. At least 25 states have laws or regulations in place that ban transgender students, particularly trans women and girls, from participating on the team that aligns with their gender identity, according to theMovement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that tracks such legislation. Cortez-Fields says that while the bans are not surprising, she fears the impact they’ll have on many trans children who may already be struggling to overcome feelings of isolation. “Part of gender affirming care, in a sense, is being able to compete on the team of your gender and with fellow people of your gender,” she said. “It’s such a small minority, but that minority does matter, and they deserve their fair participation as well.” CNN’s DJ Judd contributed to this report.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/naia-ncaa-transgender-ban-sports/index.html,CNN,A college athletics association banned transgender women from women’s sports.

President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

“The Zimbabwean workers are victims of these illegal sanctions and today we want to give them solidarity. Our message to all the oppressed people and the workers in the world is we salute you.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/workers-efforts-hailed/,The Herald,Workers’ efforts hailed,,3

Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has exposed 11 cases of fake doctors this year alone, as people take advantage of the vastness of the country’s largest referral medical institution to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central Business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,Prof Munjeri gets State-assisted funeral,,3

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic Business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and Business organisations will be held during the Business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

The late national hero and leader of the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa (ZAOGA), Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, was a visionary leader who valued the empowerment of children through education, Information and Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingimuzi Phuti said this week.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Ezekiel Guti Christian Primary School in Riverside, Chitungwiza, after touring the school as part of preparations for the Ezekiel Guti Day to be commemorated on Saturday, he said: “I am humbled by the vision of our departed hero, Baba Guti, the vision that put the concerns of a human being to reality, the vision that foresaw things that we are beginning to discover today, the importance of taking a child to school, the knowledge that it doesn’t have to be the responsibility of Government alone.

“It’s the responsibility that is more entangled with care and understanding the reason to empower somebody through education that drove him. But apart from that we are really touched by the ahead of time kind of man he was,” he said.

Deputy Minister Phuti said the programme was meant to celebrate the life of an illustrious son of Zimbabwe whose visionary leadership was noticeable not only in Zimbabwe alone but impacted lives around the world.

The ministry has partnered the Ezekiel Guti Primary School to train youths in the use of ICT.

“In honour of the legacy of Baba Guti we decided that we come in with our digital relevance hence that training we have organised in partnership with your administration.

“We hope that the training will not only open up the eyes of our youngsters but will motivate them to pursue other relevant skills from this,” he said.

Archbishop Guti’s widow, Apostle Eunor Guti expressed her gratitude to the Ministry for the partnership.

“I would like to thank the Ministry of ICT for partnering with us and joining the Zaoga family as we celebrate the life and legacy of our father, Professor Guti,” she said.

Apart from schools the Archbishop Professor Guti also established the Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University in Bindura.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zaogas-ict-vision-impressive/,The Herald,,,3
85,Business,"May Day may be a fairly quiet holiday but it is a very important one as it concentrates minds on the position of workers within the economy and the need to ensure that their contribution is recognised.

Their rights and expectations are also taken into account.

President Mnangagwa set the tone with his statement on the eve of the public holiday, that the workers are an essential part of the economic growth through their production and productivity, and their importance cannot be minimised. Without the workers there is no production and they are entitled to their fair share of the wealth their efforts produce.

The Government is the largest employer, and runs almost all the essential services that the rest of us need to produce and to work, so as Head of Government he renewed his commitment that conditions of service will be continually improved within the State sector.

There are obvious limits to just how fast remuneration can be raised and the non-monetary benefits can be implemented and increased. We are not going to print money, or even borrow money, to pay civil servants more since that just leads to economic challenges.

But as the economy grows the tax revenue grows and so more can be done each year to improve the conditions of State workers. The Government, within its fiscal discipline that is now so essential, has maintained the percentage of revenue spent on staff, and maintained it as the largest item in the budget, so economic growth automatically means more can be spent.

The commitment by the President not to take State workers for granted and to maintain the policy of continual improvement as the economy grows is, therefore, important. He recognises their essential input and he wants to treat them fairly.

The President also made his appeal to the private sector, which employs considerably more people than the State, even with the growth of self-employment, to again follow a similar policy of continual improvement and making sure that workers are treated fairly and get their fair share of the wealth being created. Again this is the result of a growing economy, growing production and growing investment.

A major plank of President Mnangagwa’s policy is the Vision 2030, pushing Zimbabwe upwards into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. That is not just a mantra, since we have to think about what that journey means.

The only way to have a successful and continuous increase in national wealth is to make sure that everyone benefits.

That in turn increases growth. Even the arch-capitalist Henry Ford grabbed that point early on as he introduced mass production of motor cars. He worked out that he was not going to succeed unless his own very large workforce could afford to buy the cars they made, so he raised wages and was able to pay these through the higher productivity his assembly lines generated as well as the growing stream of revenue from his growing sales. Everything worked together.

The growing number of the self-employed win as well when employers are fair. Those civil servants and private-sector workers spend the money they earn, and spend quite a lot of it on the goods and services that the self-employed provide. So they win and the whole nation together moves forward. In any case, the small Businesses become larger and start hiring people, so they need to remember that they must pay their new workers their just dues.

The Government follows this policy by using the small-scale farming sectors to drive rural development. The whole policy is based on the premise that converting subsistence farmers into small commercial farmers creates the wealth that drives rural industrialisation and the growing percentage of rural dwellers who provide the goods and services that the farmers require and want.

In a developed economy a huge majority of rural dwellers are not farmers, but the underlying rural economy is based on farm production, so the Second Republic rural development policy is based on fact and functional theory, not on some pipedream. Vision 2030 is based on the need for the people, as well as the national economy, to be upper middle income.

While the Second Republic has streamlined labour law, to make it easier to understand and implement, it has retained the essential core that workers and employees are human beings who have rights, as well as duties, and has retained the whole gamut of the national employment councils and workers committees that have been so effective in ensuring that employers and employees can negotiate properly and equally. It has strengthened the similar system in State service, so there is a joint negotiating forum.

The national employment councils were created in settler days to benefit the white workers. They were partially extended under the more liberal settler regime of the late 1950s to more of the formal sector, but only started flourishing fully after independence when everyone was included fully in spirit as well as law.

But they need to be used. Some sectors have very strong and effective NECs and not only do employees benefit, but employers have found that they also benefit by having agreements that work and so can be factored into operations. So they make sure that proper and accurate data is available and enforce the NEC decisions.

Some sectors have very weak NECs, the commercial workers especially, and both employers and employees need to upgrade these.  Sometimes past splits give rise to the oddity that workers in the same sector, and even under the same employer, fall under different NECs. Combining them so that the strongest and best represents all workers in a sector makes sense, for both sides.

Labour law is there to create the practical conditions that President Mnangagwa spoke so strongly about, the need for employers and employees to be fair, and for workers to receive their just share of the growing wealth and basically to ensure that workers who fulfil their duties conscientiously are not treated as cogs in a machine but as co-creators of that extra wealth.",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-drivers-of-the-economy-need-recognition-fair-remuneration/,The Herald,,,3

Zimbabweans should embrace the newly introduced local currency, the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) to ensure the country does not become a supermarket of the region.

This comes as the operationalisation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) gathers momentum.

The US dollar is in the basket of currencies used in Zimbabwe as part of the multi-currency system.

As it stands the use of US dollar dominates local transactions and according to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), Dr John Mushayavanhu, by end of 2023, over 75 percent of local transactions were being conducted in US dollars.

It is, however, feared that the dominance of the US dollar in the local market will attract more regional imports when the AfCFTA is operationalised, rendering Zimbabwe a supermarket for products from the region and beyond.

It is highly anticipated that the use of US dollar will attract more competition locally, given the competitiveness of some regionally sourced goods.

Already history has it that when the country dollarised during the inclusive Government over a decade ago, the country become a dumping ground of old automobiles, ICT materials and some home appliances among other goods, with regional and international traders taking Zimbabwe as a cheap source of US dollars.

Zimbabwe’s production costs have lately been exorbitant, influenced by multiple factors such as high production costs stemming from myriad of factors including high cost of capital, turbulent macroeconomic environment, unavailability and higher electricity prices.

However, the success of the recently introduced ZiG among other intervention measures by the Government, will undoubtedly enhance the local industry’s competitiveness compared to regional peers.

The introduction of the ZiG, a structured currency backed by gold and other precious metals, is expected to be an impetus to the stabilisation of the local economy going forward.

Speaking during the AfCFTA Tariff Offer dissemination workshop convened by the Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) and Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) on Tuesday, economist Dr Reneth Mano, said embracing the local currency would go a long way in improving the local industry’s competitiveness in face of potential cut-throat competition to be caused by the AfCFTA.

“We should be confident in our local currency, because its survival means our survival. If ZiG does not work, our industry also will not survive. The continued use of the US dollar will make us a supermarket economy as soon as this AfCFTA comes into effect.

“Making ZiG work should be the consensus or rallying point if we are serious about making wins in the AfCFTA environment. We should try to deal with our macroeconomic environment and address the difficulties in doing Business,” said Dr Mano.

Government has since maintained a tough stance against illegal foreign currency traders and stewards of arbitrage that have been perpetuating a rapid free fall of the local currency before.

According to a survey by CTC, 50 percent of the large companies are not yet ready to compete in the AfCFTA given an albatross around their operations which leaves them with higher priced goods.

Mr Tawanda Katsande of CTC, implored local companies to pull up their socks and produce quality and competitively properly priced goods so that locals do not end up preferring foreign cheap substitutes.

He called upon relevant authorities and the private sector to ensure a workable macroeconomic environment that lessens the cost of doing production locally, particularly some issues to do with availability and affordability of electricity.

“There is going to be increased competition in Zimbabwe because of the US dollar, we are now reluctant about the US dollar while other countries are hungry for it , goods are going to come here even at lower cost so that they access the greenback,” said Mr Katsande.

To be competitive, Mr Katsande said local companies should keep in touch with new technologies for efficient production processes that lessen cost of production.

He said some of the derelict equipment still being used in industry consume a lot of electricity, while there are now alternatives that use lesser and cheaper electricity.

CZI chief economist, Dr Cornelius Dube, said doing Business in Zimbabwe is not easy and the macroeconomic environment needed to sorted for local industry to be competitive.

“Cost per unit for our local companies is actually higher compared to regional peers because here someone is using inferior type of technology, capital costs are high.

“About 18 percent of total overheads are just compliance costs. The regulators try to collect as much as they can from the Business,” said Dr Dube.

The Competition and Tariff Commission in collaboration with CZI has been conducting awareness workshops on Zimbabwe’s preparedness in terms of the implementation of AfCFTA mainly focusing on tariff offer.",https://www.herald.co.zw/embrace-zig-to-survive-afcfta-competition/,The Herald,Embrace ZiG to survive AfCFTA competition,,3

88,Business,"Farmer’s Diary with Sheuneni Kurasha

Due to the increasing volume of feedback and inquiries from our readers regarding practical considerations when venturing into small livestock farming, this week’s instalment focuses on the importance of biosecurity and health management in livestock production.

Animal health management is crucial in small stock farming. As the age-old adage goes, prevention is better than cure.

Therefore, farmers must strive to always keep their livestock healthy and disease-free.

While sheep and goats are generally resilient animals, farmers must be diligent in maintaining their health. Vigilantly monitoring the farming environment and enforcing strict biosecurity measures are essential to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious pathogens.

Healthy animals are essential for maintaining productivity on the farm. When animals fall ill, they not only hinder production targets but also lead to financial losses.

Therefore, it is imperative for farmers to prioritise the well-being of all categories of animals, including bucks and rams, pregnant does and ewes, as well as newborn kids and lamps.

This entails implementing comprehensive measures for parasite control, effective vaccination management, careful environmental management and meticulous record-keeping.

Implementing biosecurity measures on farms is essential for minimising the risk of disease exposure. This not only reduces mortality rates among newborn kids and lambs but also enhances workers’ knowledge and skills in disease prevention and control.

By diligently enforcing biosecurity protocols, farms can create a safer and healthier environment for their livestock, ultimately contributing to improved overall farm productivity and sustainability.

Despite the implementation of effective health management systems, occasional illness in animals remains inevitable due to various internal and external factors.

Timely administration of appropriate veterinary medicine is crucial in mitigating the impact of these illnesses.

Therefore, it is essential that farm workers responsible for animal care are adequately trained to detect signs of illness early, enabling prompt treatment interventions.

Early detection and intervention not only contribute to the well-being of individual animals but also help prevent the spread of diseases within the herd, ultimately safeguarding overall farm productivity and sustainability.

This brings to the forefront the critical question: how to recognise sick animals within the herd? Sick sheep and goats exhibit various symptoms depending on the nature of the illness.

Some of the most common symptoms of a sick animal include fatigue with poor or no appetite, isolation from the rest of the herd, hunched posture, coarse and dull skin, heavy breathing, abnormal body temperature, faeces mixed with blood or mucus, dark yellow urine, slowed physical growth rate, red or watery eyes, elevated palpitations that can be felt by touching the interior side of the hind thigh, and drooling or excessive saliva from the mouth.

Once identified, sick animals should be separated from the rest of the herd and be treated immediately. To do this effectively, farmers and workers responsible for animal care need to have a thorough understanding of the disease and the appropriate medicine to use.

This includes knowing the correct handling procedures for medicines, such as avoiding exposure to direct sunlight and storing them at room temperature. Additionally, they must be aware of the proper dosages, which are often proportional to the animal’s weight. It is critical to always read the manual before administering any animal medicine.

It is crucial for farmers and workers who handle goats to possess comprehensive knowledge about the major diseases affecting sheep and goats, along with their underlying causes.

This understanding enables not only effective treatment but also the implementation of preventive measures, including vaccinations and management interventions.

Among the most common diseases are tick-borne illnesses like heart-water, foot rot, bloating, orf, pneumonia, brucellosis, as well as internal parasites (such as worms and flukes) and external parasites (including ticks and mites).

These diseases can have profound effects on the health, productivity, and profitability of sheep and goat farming.

Therefore, preventive measures such as vaccination, parasite control, biosecurity and sound management practices are indispensable for effectively managing and controlling diseases.

In addition, regular veterinary monitoring and timely treatment of sick animals play crucial roles in preserving the health and well-being of the flock.

Quarantining sick animals from healthy ones is a crucial animal husbandry practice for preventing the spread of disease throughout the entire herd.

Similarly, quarantine procedures should be applied to newly acquired animals being introduced to the herd from external sources.

This practice enables the farmer to closely monitor, document, and treat sick and newly acquired animals before they are allowed into the rest of the herd. Local veterinary offices can offer valuable guidance on appropriate quarantine protocols tailored to specific circumstances.

One of the primary methods to ensure the health of your sheep and goats is by providing them with sufficient and high-quality feed, along with access to clean water.

Additionally, constructing well-ventilated kraals plays a crucial role in safeguarding the animals from adverse weather conditions. Ensuring adequate space within kraals is essential to prevent overcrowding and minimise the risk of respiratory diseases.

Moreover, well-designed kraals and efficient animal handling facilities facilitate easier management during various tasks such as treatment, ear-tagging, or hoof trimming, thereby reducing stress on the animals.

This reduction in stress is particularly important as it can help mitigate the risk of diseases such as pulpy kidney and Pasteurella.

As the world commemorate International Workers’ Day, a call to action has been made to prioritise the welfare and safety of mine workers amid growing concerns about the deplorable working conditions many are forced to endure.

Mr Justice Chinhema, secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Diamond and Allied Minerals Workers Union (ZDAMWU), has expressed deep concern over the working conditions of mine workers, which he described as “modern slavery.”

ZDAMWU represents about 15 000 mine workers, a significant portion of the sector’s formal workforce of 52 000 people.

The sector accounts for Zimbabwe’s 13 percent of the gross domestic product and generate roughly 80 percent of the country’s exports.

Mr Chinhema”s call comes amid growing concerns, not only about working conditions, but also as Zimbabwe and much of southern Africa battle the effects of climate change that threaten lives and livelihoods.

The country faced a serious drought caused by El Niño, and the general well-being of mine workers had not been spared.

“Compatriots, 2024 workers day has come at a moment when mine workers are fighting tooth and nail to reclaim their rights, for a living wage and protection against excessive exploitation,” said Mr Chinhema.

“We are at a critical stage of history where we are not retreating in confronting the mistreatment of workers and believe May Day should not only be an occasion for gatherings, but it should be a day to salute the mine workers for their continued sustenance of the economy and expression of a deep appreciation to them and those who died or have been injured at the work place in mines across the country.

“Mine workers are an important stakeholder in the extraction of mineral resources worldwide, they are the vital cog that drive any economy and Zimbabwe has been one good example.

“This therefore means mine workers welfare should always be a priority. The Government and employers in the sector need to lend an ear to the concerns of the mine workers as much as possible to see that they are addressed not the current situation where workers have been turned into slaves by employers, mine workers have nothing to celebrate on this May Day as they are subjected to poor working conditions and ‘slave wages’ which have thrown them into abject poverty despite being a vital cog in our economy.”

Mr Chinhema noted that some large mines were even failing to pay salaries when due, even when production was stable.

In addition, he said many workers were forced to work long hours in dangerous environments with no guarantee of a permanent job or fair pay. ZDAMWU has called for an end to these exploitative practices and a living wage that reflects the value of the minerals being mined.

The union also wanted to see the National Employment Council (NEC) reformed to better serve the needs of mine workers, and existing safety and health laws enforced.

The union is particularly focused on protecting the rights of female mine workers.

It has since implemented a Gender and Sexual Harassment policy to address these issues in the workplace and communities. Additionally, it is advocating for the ratification of ILO C190, which protects workers from violence and harassment.

“As ZDAMWU we would like to reiterate that mine workers welfare is the reason of our existence.

“As a union we shall be pushing for the implementation of ILO C176 in Zimbabwe and other existing safety and health laws. We need to continue pushing for the criminalisation of deliberate cause of accidents particularly where it is proved that the employer has failed to comply with the safety rules and regulations,” he said.

He said the union was cognisant of the challenges being faced by female mine workers in the country.

“As a union, we would like to reaffirm our commitment to protect the rights of female mine workers. The union is committed to the emancipation of women both at the world of work and outside.

“We have recognised the challenges women face in general and have put measures and programs in place to address such anomalies and emancipation of women workers in particular,” he said.

Campaigns would be rolled at mine level, communities as well as pushing through works council for work place policy on Sexual Harassment, Gender Based Violence in the world of work.

As we push this policy to be adopted across all mines, we will continue to extensively campaign for the ratification of ILO C190 by the government of Zimbabwe through parliament.

Engagement of female parliamentarians has also begun.

Mr Chinhema said ZDAMWU was committed to organising all mines across the country and becoming a stronger voice for mine workers.",https://www.herald.co.zw/mine-workers-decry-poor-working-conditions-as-they-celebrate-may-day/,The Herald,Mine workers decry poor working conditions as they celebrate May Day,,3

Introduction

Liquidation, which is the winding up of a Business, can be voluntary or involuntary.

It is done in terms of the Insolvency Act (Chapter 6:07), “the Insolvency Act” or “the Act”. In this article I consider voluntary liquidation of solvent companies.

Liquidation of a solvent company

Section 10 of the Insolvency Act regulates voluntary liquidation of a solvent company. A solvent company is one that is not financially distressed.

Eligible for voluntary liquidation

According to section 10 (1) a solvent company that is not an external company or foreign company in terms of the Companies and Other Business Entities Act (Chapter 24:31) or “the COBE Act”, or a solvent private Business corporation (“PBC”), may be liquidated voluntarily if the company or corporation has adopted a special resolution to be liquidated as a voluntary liquidation by its members.

Liquidation resolution

According to section 10 (2), the resolution must be filed with the Registrar of Companies who must immediately after its registration transmit a copy thereof to the Master of the High Court.

The filing of a liquidation resolution must comply with the procedures set down from time to time by the Registrar of Companies. According to section 10 (8), a voluntary liquidation of a company or PBC by its members commences when the special resolution has been filed in terms of section 10 (2).

Liquidator

In terms of section 10 (6), the nomination of a liquidator in terms of an adopted liquidation resolution in terms of this section (Section 10) is of no force and effect and the Master must appoint a liquidator in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

A liquidator appointed in a voluntary liquidation by members may exercise all powers given by the Insolvency Act to a liquidator:

Without requiring specific order or sanction of the Court.

Subject to any directions given by the shareholders of the company in a general meeting or by the members of a PBC.

Legal status during voluntary liquidation

According to section 10 (9), despite any provision to the contrary in a Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation, Articles of Association, or Shareholders agreement or in the founding statement of a PBC:

The company or PBC remains a juristic person and retains all of its powers as such while it is being liquidated voluntarily.

However, from the commencement of the company or PBC’s liquidation:

It must stop carrying on its Business except to the extent required for the beneficial liquidation of the company or PBC, or

All of the powers of the company’s directors or members of the PBC, cease, except to the extent specifically authorised by the liquidator or the shareholders or members in a general meeting.

Conclusion

Liquidation of an insolvent company or PBC may be voluntary or involuntary. A solvent company or PBC may be liquidated through a special resolution of its shareholders or members. It is important to fully understand the formalities required by the Insolvency Act to avoid a legal nullity or fatal non-compliance.

The central Business districts (CBD) office space in major urban centres remained depressed during the second half of financial year 2023, with voids expected to worsen, according to analysts’ projections.

This comes as the property market in general continues to experience limited activity, primarily centred around commercial and industrial sales and development.

A market update for the sector for the period under review shows vacancy rates ranged from between 40 percent and 60 percent and projections indicate a potential increase.

According to real estate consultants, Knight Frank Zimbabwe, the subdued performance is driven by corporate relocations from large office spaces to suburban areas.

The relocations have largely resulted in an increase in voids, although budding small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are taking up space, repartitioned into smaller spaces to accommodate their small Businesses.

“Demand for CBD office space primarily originates from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking minimal space,” said Knight Frank.

As companies laid off staff due to operational challenges and the Covid-19 pandemic, the employees resorted to start their own Businesses mainly apparel, beauty and hair products as well as electronic gadgets retailing.

This boom in the SME sector especially the retail side, has seen landlords repartitioning space into smaller units to meet the rising demand from the SME sector. In Harare’s CBD, big companies like Meikles and Mashonaland Holdings, have repurposed their buildings to accommodate the SME retail sector.

This also comes as the rate of new office development from both institutional and private entities in Zimbabwe remains low, according to Knight Frank.

Notably, The Strand Corporate Office Park stands out as a significant prime office development situated along Borrowdale Road.

Comprising ten subdivisions ranging between 7000 and just over 9,000 square meters, this premier office park commands asking prices of approximately US$125 per square metre.

The transition to predominantly US dollar rentals in the office sector has been slower compared to the residential market, largely influenced by corporate entities, which constitute the majority of players in this sector.

According to the market update report, rental rates in the CBD range from US$6 to US$10 per square metre for office spaces, contingent upon the condition and amenities offered by the respective office premises.

“Overall, the demand for suburban offices continues to thrive, with vacant spaces in these areas being readily leased compared to those in the CBD,” said Knight Frank.

The yield achieved in the CBD remains at 8 percent. Notably, financial institutions and privately-owned firms are driving the construction of new headquarters and leasing properties in suburban locations.

Listed banking group NMB, is one of the institutions that have led this trend, while FCB is also working on the construction of its new headquarters in Borrowdale. Property firm, WestProp Holdings also indicated its board approved the development of a modern headquarters in Borrowdale.

This also comes as Businesses shy away from CBD challenges ranging from high traffic congestion, parking space, dirty and smelly alleys, noise and air pollution, the menace from illegal transport operators and vendors and what has been termed the general decay of the CBD.

Zimbabwe’s milk production rose 21 percent to 27,3 million litres during the first quarter of 2024 from 22,61 million litres in the same period last year, latest data shows.

It comes as the Zimbabwe Association for Dairy Farmers (ZADF) is expecting reduced feed stocks in the form of roughage (maize silage) and protein sources due to the effects of the El Nino-induced drought, which will affect national milk production and productivity.

Statistics from the Agriculture Ministry’s Dairy Services Department, show that the country’s milk intake by processors went up 21 percent in the first quarter of 2024 to 25,07 million litres from 20,74 million litres in the comparative period.

Retail milk production increased by 19 percent to 2,22 million litres in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 1,86 million litres in the first quarter of 2023.

Average milk output for the period under review stood at 9,1 million litres. In the first quarter of 2023, the country’s average milk output stood at 7,53 million litres.

In March this year, the country’s milk production appreciated by 19 percent to 8,96 million litres, compared to 7,51 million litres in March last year.

At 8,96 million litres, March 2024 milk production was up 2 percent from 8,81 million litres recorded in February this year.

January milk output of 9.52 million litres is the highest so far.

The annual milk requirement stands at about 120 million litres and the country has been supplementing through imports.

Zimbabwe milk production rose nine percent to 99,82 million litres in 2023 from 91,39 million litres in 2022.

However, it was projected to reach 100 million litres, a 7,5 percent increase in milk output when compared with 2022, but slightly below the set target of 103 million litres for 2023.

This surge in production can be attributed to strategic interventions by the government, particularly the implementation of the Presidential Silage Inputs Scheme.

It was designed to enhance the quality and quantity of livestock feed and has played a pivotal role in transforming the dairy landscape. The programme provides farmers with subsidized silage inputs, ensuring a consistent and nutritious diet for dairy cows, ultimately contributing to increased milk yields.

The silage production programme to address viability challenges emanating from high-feed costs as the dairy sector is saddled by huge overhead costs headlined by stockfeed which accounts for 70 percent of the bill.

Success of the silage inputs scheme can be merged with the European Union US$7 million funding facility to Zimbabwe which benefited small-to-medium-scale dairy farmers in the form of 500 in-calf heifers in 2021 under the Transforming Zimbabwe’s Dairy Value Chain project.

This has seen the rising number of dairy cows being actively milked across the country. Currently, approximately 35,000 dairy cows are contributing to the increased production levels, showcasing the tangible results of these agricultural initiatives.

The interventions were part of the country’s Livestock Recovery and Growth Plan, with a deliberate effort on increasing the national dairy herd from 19,000 in 2021 to 40,000 in 2025.",https://www.herald.co.zw/milk-production-rises-21-percent/,The Herald,Milk production rises 21 percent,,3

Local financial institution, Metbank, has said it is seeking funds from external partners to support its clients through long-term capital financing.

Dr Linda Chipunza, Metbank’s board chairperson, said the institution was looking to support the economy through long term capital support to industry.

“Metbank will continue to engage with all the relevant funding partners in raising long-term capital to support the country’s economic development aspirations,” revealed the chairperson.

Through securing funds from external partners, Metbank aims to inject vital capital into sectors crucial for national development, thereby fostering sustainable economic expansion.

Long-term capital financing offers several distinct advantages to both Businesses and the economy at large.

This provides stability and assurance to industries, enabling them to undertake large-scale projects and long-term investments with confidence.

In terms of capitalisation, Dr Chipunza said: “The Bank remained compliant with the revised regulatory minimum capital requirements for commercial banks and is pleased that it has continued to grow its capital base well beyond the minimum thresholds.”

Going forward, the Bank said its capitalisation will continue to be driven through organic growth with any anticipated shortfalls being covered through shareholder injections.

“The operating environment remains challenging but we remain optimistic that the Bank will maintain an upward growth trajectory, anchored by its strong statement of its financial position. In the implementation of the Bank’s strategy for the delivery of unique customer value propositions, innovation and digitalisation remain our core objectives,” she added.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, Metbank reported a historical comprehensive income of $547,8 billion compared to $66,8 billion in the comparative period.

The gains were underpinned by revaluation gains of their investment property portfolio which was a result of decisive strategic actions made by the Bank to hedge the balance sheet against exchange rate and inflationary pressures.

Dr Chipunza said: “The continued local currency depreciation resulted in increased operating costs in the review period.

“The Bank’s focus remained on increasing foreign currency revenue streams through underwriting loans denominated in foreign currency to act as a hedge against exchange rate depreciation and inflation that will also produce long-term, sustainable profitability.”

Metbank has continued to focus on its digitalisation drive in order to enhance customer satisfaction and convenience.

“Operational and financial resilience is of paramount importance to the Bank supported by robust Business continuity and succession planning arrangements.

“The Bank’s board of directors therefore remains resolute with the responsibility of protecting the interests of stakeholders,” the chairperson added.",https://www.herald.co.zw/metbank-seeks-external-funds-to-support-clients/,The Herald,Metbank seeks external funds to support clients,,3

Investors should not dismiss South Africa over its other continental peers as it has strong institutions that can buttress its economy if it focuses on accelerating growth, the head of research at Standard Chartered Bank said.

“With some institutional strength in terms of the debate around fiscal rules, its existing revenue-collection ratios, the South Africa Reserve Bank, which is a major part of the institutional strength of the country, I think there’s still a lot going for South Africa,” Razia Khan said in an interview. “All it needs now is to really focus on how to kick-start growth.”

Africa’s most industrialised economy has been hamstrung by almost daily power cuts, crime and fraying transport networks. To try combat these challenges, the authorities have instituted a number of reforms.

Data from PWC’s Private Business Attractiveness Index suggests that despite the operational challenges, South Africa is becoming a more attractive location for private Business, compared to countries in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.

It ranked 23rd out of 33 countries surveyed for the index in 2023, compared with 31st in 2021. Peers — Kenya ranked 32nd and Nigeria came last.

Still, without the growth push, South Africa’s economy is expected to lag other big regional economies that are also implementing reforms. The International Monetary Fund expects its economy to expand 0,9 percent this year, Nigeria’s 3,3 percent and Egypt’s 3 percent.

“South Africa doesn’t have that natural lever to pull — that is suddenly going to shoot the lights out from a growth perspective, and this is where the country does need to try a lot harder, having seen over a decade of growth under-performance,” Khan said.

Its gains and those of Egypt and Nigeria are going to become more critical if the continent wants to reset the Africa growth story, as some of its former superstars flounder, she said.

Among them are Ethiopia — that’s lost lustre after its recent civil conflict and Mozambique, which is battling an insurgency that is impairing its ability to explore its resource wealth.

“China and Airbus have found good common ground together … and this cooperation is really a flagship of the Sino-French relationship.

“We expect that the Chinese market will keep growing and believe in the huge potential in China,” Olivier Malet, CFO of Airbus China, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

“As a partner of China for nearly 40 years, Airbus wants to stay and take part in this growth of aviation,” said Malet.

Growth and evolution have defined Airbus’s history in China since 1994, when the company first established an official presence in the country.

Fourteen years later, in 2008, Airbus opened its first assembly line outside Europe in China’s northern city of Tianjin.

Airbus is currently promoting the A320 series aircraft’s second final assembly line project. “We recently launched the second assembly line in Tianjin,” he said.

“This second assembly line is a sign of the strong relationship between France and China, and it demonstrates that we are quite satisfied with the ecosystem and setup we have established here,” emphasised the CFO.

“We believe these aircraft will be very suitable for the Chinese market.”

Noting that aerospace manufacturing demands stringent quality and reliability requirements, Malet said that “Airbus produced ‘made in China’ is the same as one made in Toulouse, in Hamburg, in Mobile of the United States . . . . And for me, that is very important.”

Today, Airbus China has more than 200 local suppliers under an increasingly sophisticated supply chain ecosystem. The inclusion of Chinese elements in Airbus aircraft is growing. This deep cooperation benefits enterprises and contributes to the high-level development of the Chinese aviation industry.

Malet said addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development are shared global challenges and common goals between China and France, adding that Airbus aims to pioneer sustainable aerospace.

“We want to work with China on flying greener,” he said.

With China being Airbus’s “largest single market,” Malet believes that China’s continuous advancement of high-level opening-up and ongoing improvement of the Business environment will bring confidence and opportunities to global enterprises, including Airbus China.

Celebrating the significant milestone of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, he said bilateral economic and trade cooperation, alongside cultural exchanges, is burgeoning between the two countries.

“In recent years, France and China have worked closely on topics like trade, aviation and culture,” said Malet. “We feel very honoured to be part of it and to contribute to this high-quality relationship.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/high-tech-alliance-a-flagship-of-sino-french-relation-airbus-china-cfo/,The Herald,High-tech alliance a ‘flagship’ of Sino-French relation: Airbus China CFO,,3
97,Business,"China is making a huge contribution to the fight against climate change by drastically reducing the cost of green energies, a top German executive has said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.

Via scale production, China has driven down costs to such a low level within the space of 10 years that solar power has now become the cheapest energy source, said Herbert Diess, chairman of the supervisory board of Infineon Technologies.

Diess said the reduced price is “a huge benefit”, and that when looking back in a few decades’ time, it will probably be China that has contributed most to tackling climate change.

Like wind and solar power, new energy technologies are expected to become “cheaper by the month” as Chinese automakers intensify competition in the auto market, Diess noted.

He echoed some German automakers by explicitly standing against European Union (EU) measures, which would impose additional import tariffs on Chinese EVs.

This is “the wrong way to go now,” Deiss said, explaining that if one side decides to increase tariffs, the other side will follow suit and cars will become more expensive.

“In the end, European car makers can’t be in favour of import taxes here because it would also hurt them,” he added.

The German auto industry is investing in China because it has become “the new cluster for new energy vehicles,” he underlined.

Not only does China have the largest new energy vehicle market, but also the most competitive auto companies, components manufacturers and cutting-edge technologies such as autonomous driving.

“If you want to be long-term successful, you have to be in China now — and not only for manufacturing. You also have to do R&D in China.”

Meanwhile, Chinese automakers who want to win over the EU market should “become local players, understand the local customer, make a plan over a decade or two, and not expect that in half a year you can win the game,” Deiss said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/china-making-huge-input-to-fight-against-climate-change-german-executive/,The Herald,China making huge input to fight against climate change: German executive,,3

The market has been generally stable since the announcement of the 2024 Monetary Policy Statement by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu, which introduced the new ZiG currency and is expected to ensure lasting stability, certainty and predictability in the exchange rate and inflation.

In a statement yesterday after a follow-up meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) last Friday, Dr Mushayavanhu said the committee deliberated on the recent macroeconomic and financial developments following the announcement of the monetary policy statement on April 5.

One of the major policies brought by the statement was the introduction of the new ZiG (local currency), backed by gold, other precious minerals and foreign currency reserves.

Dr Mushayavanhu said the MPC noted that the monetary policy statement was “well received by the market”.

“Preliminary indications since the announcement of the MPS show that the markets have been fairly stable,” he said. 

“In this regard, the MPC affirmed its commitment to the consolidation of these positive sentiments and ensure a quick restoration of confidence, trust and anchoring of inflation expectations. 

Dr Mushayavanhu said considering the initial positive reaction from the market, the MPC has resolved to maintain the current bank policy rate at 20 percent a year and an interest rate corridor of 11 percent to 25 percent to maintain the statutory reserve requirements for demand deposits, with savings in ZiG at 15 percent and time deposits at 5 percent, respectively.

Further, the MPC resolved to maintain the statutory reserve requirements for demand deposits and savings and time deposits in foreign currency at 20 percent and 5 percent respectively. 

Dr Mushayavanhu said the MPC will proactively review the monetary policy measures in line with the exchange rate and inflation developments. 

He said to support the tight monetary policy stance, the MPC emphasised the need for the Reserve Bank to continue to work closely with the Government for a robust liquidity management system through the joint Liquidity Management Committee to contain money supply growth to the desired levels determined by targeted inflation, growth of the economy and increase in foreign reserves backing the ZiG currency. 

This cooperation would ensure the creation of effective demand for the domestic currency through strict adherence to the multicurrency system by all in the economy, consistent with the multicurrency system except for exempted services.

The RBZ would work closely with the Government to encourage the increased use of ZiG for payment of goods and services to public entities, including the settling of tax obligations on quarterly payments dates. 

Added Dr Mushayavanhu: “The MPC also directed the Reserve Bank to ensure that there is effective communication on the new structured currency, ZiG, to cover the whole country to ensure that there is financial inclusion. 

“The Reserve Bank was also directed to ensure that, at all times, any growth in reserve money is fully covered by reserves, in the form of gold, other precious minerals and foreign currency balances in the Reserve Bank’s nostro account.”

Zimbabwe imported 410 667 tonnes of maize worth US$128 million in the first three months of this year to cover a deficit occasioned by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

The Government has partnered with the private sector to mitigate the effects of the drought.

Figures from the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZimStat) show that the country imported 136 084 tonnes of maize worth US$41,95 million in January. 

This was followed by a further 145 354 tonnes valued at US$43,7 million in February, while US$42,4 million was spent on 129 229 tonnes of maize in March.

The country spent an average of 5,98 percent of its import bill on maize.

The Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) expects to import one million tonnes of grain between now and March 2025.

It is likely that Zimbabwe will spend more on importing grain in the coming months.

Economist Tinevimbo Shava said: “Zimbabwe’s proactive approach to addressing the food deficit through increased maize imports demonstrates a commitment to ensuring food security for its citizens, especially in the face of challenges like the El Nino-induced drought.”

“The Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe’s initiative to import one million tonnes of grain underscores the proactive measures being taken to prevent drought-induced hunger, reflecting a concerted effort to safeguard the well-being of the population.”

President Mnangagwa declared the drought a national disaster in March this year. Malawi and Zambia, Zimbabwe’s neighbours, have also separately declared the drought a State of National Disaster.

El Niño refers to a cycle of warming and cooling events that happens along the equator in the Pacific Ocean, leading to an increase in sea surface temperatures across the Pacific. The warming phase of the phenomenon — El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) stimulates drought conditions. 

ENSO creates both dry and hot conditions that negatively affect food crops. The cooling part of the cycle is called La Niña and has the opposite effect.

Severe drought in Southern Africa left millions in need of relief food. President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe needed US$2 billion to address food security needs for millions of its citizens.

“No Zimbabwean must succumb or die from hunger,” the President told a press conference. “To that end, I do hereby declare a nationwide State of Disaster, due to the El Nino-induced drought.”

He revealed that over 2,7 million people, or around a sixth of the country’s population, did not have adequate access to food this year due to low yields caused by the drought.

The Government granted companies and individuals permission to import maize, rice, and cooking oil — free from duty with effect from July 2024 to avert looming food shortages emanating from El Nino effects.

Economic analyst Namatai Maeresera believes that the collaboration between the Government and the private sector to import maize is a commendable step towards mitigating the effects of the drought and ensuring a stable food supply chain in Zimbabwe.

“The Government’s decision to grant duty-free importation of essential food items like maize, rice and cooking oil demonstrates a responsive approach to addressing looming food shortages, highlighting a commitment to meeting the basic needs of the population during challenging times,” he said.

Other measures taken by the Government to beef up stocks includes the purchase of local grain at an import parity price of US$390 per tonne to mop up excess local grain.

Speaking during a post-Cabinet media briefing in March, the Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Dr Jenfan Muswere said the importation of genetically modified grain would be for stockfeed production.

“The Government has okayed a duty waiver on the importation of rice and potato seed, and the importation of genetically modified maize for stock feed, under strictly supervised milling and distribution,” the Minister stated.

The Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Dr Anxious Masuka added that rice and potatoes would be regarded as key staples to ensure national food security.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zim-imports-410-667t-maize-in-q1/,The Herald,Zim imports 410 667t maize in Q1,,3

Analysts have projected improved 2024 performance for the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) listed firm — Caledonia Mining Plc, as the resources group addresses some of the setbacks experienced during the prior year.

The group, earlier in March, issued a profit warning, as it projected depressed full-year profitability weighed by increased operating costs at its Gwanda-based Blanket Mine, consisting of higher-than-expected overtime payments and electricity costs.

Caledonia incurred several significant one-offs, non-operating costs during the fourth quarter (Q4) period, which were expected to have a knock-on effect on profitability for the full year to December 31, 2023.

Its fourth quarter saw the commencement of work at its second asset, Bilboes, with operations centred on mining and processing oxides. The oxides project yielded 3 050 ounces of gold at an average grade of 1,13 grade per tonne in the period under review.

Operations were, however, hindered by an unforeseen need for extensive waste, stripping in the relevant areas and inaccurate mineralisation maps, resulting in the project not meeting its expected output of between 12,500 ounces and 17,000 ounces.

As a result, the group’s aggregate gold production for FY23 registered at 78,466 ounces, a 3 percent decline from the 80,775 ounces in the prior comparable year.

While the group experienced these challenges, research firm IH Securities sees better prospects for the resources group.

“Whilst Caledonia experienced significant setbacks in FY23, we foresee alleviation of some key issues in the current year,” said IH Securities.

As per management reports, running costs at Bilboes after it was placed under care and maintenance, have fallen from US$1 million per month to US$0,2 million.

“However, work on the much larger scale Bilboes sulphides project is still ongoing in the background with the existing feasibility study now at an advanced stage,” said the research firm.

Indicative gold production at Blanket Mine for the year has been set at between 74,000 and 78,000 ounces at an on-mine cost and AISC foreseen at an upper range of US$970 and US$1,470 per ounce, respectively.

Electricity costs are notably expected to remain high in the short term and then decrease as older, less efficient infrastructure, gets decommissioned.

Management has also shown optimism that the cost increases experienced in the prior year will not extend into 2024, while year-to-date production and costs at Blanket Mine is within expectations of full-year guidance so far.

Additionally, the resources group is also introducing measures aimed at reducing electricity costs over the medium term.

“A number of the other cost items are not anticipated to be recurring, whereas others have arisen from our decisions to invest in the Business, most notably around personnel and advancing the Bilboes sulphide project.

“I am confident that many of these will not recur in 2024, which has started positively and I look forward to the future with optimism, as we pursue our goal of becoming a multi-asset production company,” said group chief executive Mr Mark Learmonth in an earlier communication.

As a result, the group is expected to see an improvement in margins.

“At an average gold price of US$2,226 per ounce, we anticipate that Caledonia will register revenue of US$171 million in FY24.

“Margins are expected to improve in the year, with an EBITDA margin foreseen to firm up to 43,3 percent.

President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

“The Zimbabwean workers are victims of these illegal sanctions and today we want to give them solidarity. Our message to all the oppressed people and the workers in the world is we salute you.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/workers-efforts-hailed/,The Herald,Workers’ efforts hailed,,2

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central Business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

He has since appeared in court.",https://www.herald.co.zw/pari-exposes-11-fake-doctors-in-4-months/,The Herald,Pari exposes 11 fake doctors in 4 months,,2

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,,,2

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

“I don’t want to appear like we want to reverse the brain drain, but let those who train in Zambia remain in Zambia and those we train remain here.",https://www.herald.co.zw/health-workforce-to-double-by-2028/,The Herald,,,2

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic Business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and Business organisations will be held during the Business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

The late national hero and leader of the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa (ZAOGA), Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, was a visionary leader who valued the empowerment of children through education, Information and Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingimuzi Phuti said this week.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Ezekiel Guti Christian Primary School in Riverside, Chitungwiza, after touring the school as part of preparations for the Ezekiel Guti Day to be commemorated on Saturday, he said: “I am humbled by the vision of our departed hero, Baba Guti, the vision that put the concerns of a human being to reality, the vision that foresaw things that we are beginning to discover today, the importance of taking a child to school, the knowledge that it doesn’t have to be the responsibility of Government alone.

“It’s the responsibility that is more entangled with care and understanding the reason to empower somebody through education that drove him. But apart from that we are really touched by the ahead of time kind of man he was,” he said.

Deputy Minister Phuti said the programme was meant to celebrate the life of an illustrious son of Zimbabwe whose visionary leadership was noticeable not only in Zimbabwe alone but impacted lives around the world.

The ministry has partnered the Ezekiel Guti Primary School to train youths in the use of ICT.

“In honour of the legacy of Baba Guti we decided that we come in with our digital relevance hence that training we have organised in partnership with your administration.

“We hope that the training will not only open up the eyes of our youngsters but will motivate them to pursue other relevant skills from this,” he said.

Archbishop Guti’s widow, Apostle Eunor Guti expressed her gratitude to the Ministry for the partnership.

“I would like to thank the Ministry of ICT for partnering with us and joining the Zaoga family as we celebrate the life and legacy of our father, Professor Guti,” she said.

107,Entertainment,"May Day may be a fairly quiet holiday but it is a very important one as it concentrates minds on the position of workers within the economy and the need to ensure that their contribution is recognised.

Their rights and expectations are also taken into account.

President Mnangagwa set the tone with his statement on the eve of the public holiday, that the workers are an essential part of the economic growth through their production and productivity, and their importance cannot be minimised. Without the workers there is no production and they are entitled to their fair share of the wealth their efforts produce.

The Government is the largest employer, and runs almost all the essential services that the rest of us need to produce and to work, so as Head of Government he renewed his commitment that conditions of service will be continually improved within the State sector.

There are obvious limits to just how fast remuneration can be raised and the non-monetary benefits can be implemented and increased. We are not going to print money, or even borrow money, to pay civil servants more since that just leads to economic challenges.

But as the economy grows the tax revenue grows and so more can be done each year to improve the conditions of State workers. The Government, within its fiscal discipline that is now so essential, has maintained the percentage of revenue spent on staff, and maintained it as the largest item in the budget, so economic growth automatically means more can be spent.

The commitment by the President not to take State workers for granted and to maintain the policy of continual improvement as the economy grows is, therefore, important. He recognises their essential input and he wants to treat them fairly.

The President also made his appeal to the private sector, which employs considerably more people than the State, even with the growth of self-employment, to again follow a similar policy of continual improvement and making sure that workers are treated fairly and get their fair share of the wealth being created. Again this is the result of a growing economy, growing production and growing investment.

A major plank of President Mnangagwa’s policy is the Vision 2030, pushing Zimbabwe upwards into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. That is not just a mantra, since we have to think about what that journey means.

The only way to have a successful and continuous increase in national wealth is to make sure that everyone benefits.

That in turn increases growth. Even the arch-capitalist Henry Ford grabbed that point early on as he introduced mass production of motor cars. He worked out that he was not going to succeed unless his own very large workforce could afford to buy the cars they made, so he raised wages and was able to pay these through the higher productivity his assembly lines generated as well as the growing stream of revenue from his growing sales. Everything worked together.

The growing number of the self-employed win as well when employers are fair. Those civil servants and private-sector workers spend the money they earn, and spend quite a lot of it on the goods and services that the self-employed provide. So they win and the whole nation together moves forward. In any case, the small Businesses become larger and start hiring people, so they need to remember that they must pay their new workers their just dues.

The Government follows this policy by using the small-scale farming sectors to drive rural development. The whole policy is based on the premise that converting subsistence farmers into small commercial farmers creates the wealth that drives rural industrialisation and the growing percentage of rural dwellers who provide the goods and services that the farmers require and want.

In a developed economy a huge majority of rural dwellers are not farmers, but the underlying rural economy is based on farm production, so the Second Republic rural development policy is based on fact and functional theory, not on some pipedream. Vision 2030 is based on the need for the people, as well as the national economy, to be upper middle income.

While the Second Republic has streamlined labour law, to make it easier to understand and implement, it has retained the essential core that workers and employees are human beings who have rights, as well as duties, and has retained the whole gamut of the national employment councils and workers committees that have been so effective in ensuring that employers and employees can negotiate properly and equally. It has strengthened the similar system in State service, so there is a joint negotiating forum.

The national employment councils were created in settler days to benefit the white workers. They were partially extended under the more liberal settler regime of the late 1950s to more of the formal sector, but only started flourishing fully after independence when everyone was included fully in spirit as well as law.

But they need to be used. Some sectors have very strong and effective NECs and not only do employees benefit, but employers have found that they also benefit by having agreements that work and so can be factored into operations. So they make sure that proper and accurate data is available and enforce the NEC decisions.

Some sectors have very weak NECs, the commercial workers especially, and both employers and employees need to upgrade these.  Sometimes past splits give rise to the oddity that workers in the same sector, and even under the same employer, fall under different NECs. Combining them so that the strongest and best represents all workers in a sector makes sense, for both sides.

Labour law is there to create the practical conditions that President Mnangagwa spoke so strongly about, the need for employers and employees to be fair, and for workers to receive their just share of the growing wealth and basically to ensure that workers who fulfil their duties conscientiously are not treated as cogs in a machine but as co-creators of that extra wealth.",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-drivers-of-the-economy-need-recognition-fair-remuneration/,The Herald,,,2

The stage is set for the launch of the award-winning interdenominational choir, ZimPraise Legacy’s Season 16, dubbed “The Love Project”, this Saturday night.

Themed “Under the Stars”, the live album launch will be held at Harare Gardens and will see a star-studded line-up of artistes sharing the stage with the choir.

The line-up includes Pastor G, Everton Mlalazi, Kuda Mutsvene, Dorcas Moyo, Jonah Chivasa, Benjamin Rupapa and The Unveiled.

In February they had a listener’s session with some of their fans including Business personalities and celebrities, who had a chance to sample the album before its launch, before the choir then went back and perfected the album.

“ZimPraise Season 16”, which is part of the 21 albums, will see the choir sampling the songs live on stage, including some of their collaborations.

In an interview, the choir’s founder member, Joseph Madziyire, said this is a busy season for them.

“We recorded the album in Nyanga and Vumba and I am happy all went well. Now we are launching the album and expect some fireworks,”   he said.

Madziyire said they titled the album “The Love Project – Season 16” because it was first pre-launched in the month of love, Jand the songs are dedicated to the love of Jesus.

He clarified that it is not the 16th album but Season 16.

“Well, we have 21 albums, including ‘Hymnal Night’. Some of the songs to listen to on Season 16, include ‘Dai Mapindira’, ‘Hallelujah’, ‘Musanditendera’, ‘Ufanelwe’, ‘Murudo’ and ‘Mukuru Wevakuru’ among  others.

“We are going to play them at Harare Gardens and we will also share some of the videos with the fans.

“I am happy with how corporates have jumped on board, supporting and endorsing Season 16. It would be myopic not to thank Nyaradzo (Phillip Mataranyika) and my Business brothers and sisters,” he said.

Madziyire said some of the songs on Season 16 have shown that the album has strong influence from Afro-fusion, sungura and contemporary music. Along with the six-track list, Madziyire released the credits for the artistes, composers, co-producers and song-writers with whom he collaborated.

They include the likes of Everton Mlalazi, Tino Dambaneuga, Shammah Phiri, Spirit Fingers and Emmanuel Chiwangwa.

Afro-fusion-jazz artiste Agga Nyabinde’s album launch at 7 Arts Theatre in Harare last week was a success as he thrilled the crowd, keeping them on their feet with every    chorus.

The crowd could not help but be drawn in as the sound quality was excellent.

This was his first album since the death of his father, “The Headmaster”, and he did not disappoint his fans.

The 11-track album, titled “Honai”, has three tracks dedicated to his late father, Bob Nyabinde, and the musician said it is of sentimental value as it is the very first album he is doing without his father.

He wowed the crowd with “Chabuda Hapana” and the fans sang along perfectly.

Fellow artistes  who graced the launch praised Agga for a well-polished  album.

“I am grateful to be part of this event, it is such a great honour. What my brother did tonight was amazing. I am proud of him,” said Taffie Matiure.

Also on stage was musician Dereck Mpofu, who put up a spectacular act as he dished out “Mari (Unonaka Iwe)” and “Ndinokakama”, keeping the crowd on their feet on the dance floor.

“It is always a happy and joyous occasion when we come together to support one of our own. What Agga did tonight cannot be explained. Everything was on point and it’s quite amazing how the crowd responded. Well done bro!”

Other artistes featured on the album include Selmor Mtukudzi and  Mbeu.

Selmor gave a spirited performance as she joined Agga on stage for their song “Kufara kweumwe”.

Cool crooner Victor Kunonga (Nduna) also joined Agga on stage for a performance of their song “Kutumira”.

Wrapping up the launch Agga acknowledged fellow artistes and fans for making the show a success.

“The turn-out was amazing and I would love to thank fellow artistes and fans who came in their numbers. The support I got from fellow musicians is amazing.

“I would also like to extend my sincerest gratitude to partners and stakeholders who made this possible,” said Agga.

He also promised to release videos of each of his songs from the album every month.

Other artistes who performed were Vazukuru veAfrica, Matiure, Tariro Negitare and Mwenje Mathole.

Fans also saluted Agga for the album launch.

An excited fan, Chioniso Mpofu, said; “This is a top drawer performance, I had value for my money. The sound was amazing and the performances were top-notch. I am happy for Agga,” as she drove off reminiscing and singing to one of Agga’s songs.

Another fan, Wealth Masendu, said Agga was following his father’s   footsteps.

“I enjoyed his new songs. He is following in his father’s footsteps, which is good because his father’s legacy continues. If he carries on like this, he will get to his father’s level or even surpass it,” he said.

Jayne Matambanashe, also a fan, said his album showcased Agga’s dedication to the music industry.

“This was a well-written piece of work with a lot of handiwork on it, which shows that he is committed to his music career.

“I would also want to applaud him for working with his brother Albert, and they should continue doing so.

Desmond Chikamhi, a Mandela Washington fellow and development practitioner, is set to launch his first book titled “Yes You Can” on Friday at Cresta Jameson Hotel in Harare from 5pm to 9pm.

The World Life Changers founder and executive director, who has been involved in community development since 2018, said the book is designed to open readers’ minds to a world of possibilities in spite of their circumstances.

“The book carries some invaluable wisdom nuggets for a victorious life and my hope is that it will unleash a culture of excellence and productivity amongst our people.

“It is a landmark motivational publication designed to equip and empower readers to chase their dreams and bring them to fruition.

“It is an antidote to the lethargy, demotivation and fear,” Chikamhi said.

The Zaka-born community builder, who grew up under challenging circumstances, said the wisdom in the book is derived from his difficult personal experiences.

“The goal is to demonstrate that impossibilities only exist in our minds. Once we reconfigure our minds to operate in a positive way, nothing is impossible. Life is there for the taking for anyone who can dash and grab it with both hands.

“The book launch is, therefore, going to be a life celebration as we share ideas and life nuggets on how to get ahead and stay ahead. Its all about daring each other not only to dream, but to also see our dreams materialising,” Chikamhi said.

The event is set to be curated by creative agency Esteem Communications while various influencers, corporate leaders and creatives are expected to attend the event.

“We have enlisted the services of Esteem Communications to help us curate the launch and all is in place for an uplifting life experience.

Music and Entertainment will be provided by Sabastian Magacha, Mavery very, Loice Manzunzu, Fire Colloso and Simbarashe Mparira,” Chikamhi said.

Chikamhi, who has implemented a number of life changing community development projects around Zimbabwe, said working with vulnerable communities to change their lives was the biggest inspiration behind the book.

“Working with communities and getting to change their lives through our organisation was the biggest inspiration behind this book. My eyes were opened to possibilities and I want fellow Zimbabweans and readers across the world to see things the same way.

During Cyclone Idai, we assisted over 10 000 families in Chimanimani under one of our Disaster and Relief Programmes, where we respond to natural disasters that befall our vulnerable communities.

The Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA) has appointed Fungai Zvirawa as the new chief executive officer.

Zvirawa who is affectionately known as “Kush”, took over from Reason Sibanda who steered the music related body for the past five years.

ZIMA chairperson Joseph Nyadzayo said Zvirawa has vast experience, having worked with internationally acclaimed artistes.

“The Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA) is thrilled to announce the appointment of Fungai Zvirawa as its new Chief Executive Officer. Fungai has a robust background spanning over a decade in the music industry. Ms Zvirawa brings with her a wealth of experience in artiste management, event organisation and the creation of innovative campaigns that seamlessly blend the creative and corporate realms,” said Nyadzayo.

“Kush has vast experience; she came in as an internationally accredited figure having worked with great people in the industry. Coming in from the United Kingdom, she will actually make  ZIMA attain global accolades,” he said.

Nyadzayo said Kush came to deliver and to prop up the music awards body to higher levels.

“We know Kush is a deliverer and a hard worker, we had a run with her during the last edition. She was part of the team to familiarise her with the system. To appoint her, we are actually sure that she has what it takes to head ZIMA. Kush has other successes in advertising, even in the music industry” said Nyadzayo.

In her acceptance speech Kush promised to deliver and to upscale the status of musicians with the locals being the first port of call.

“I’m very excited with the new appointment that I now have, my vision is to give the music awards a new dimension and to continue enhancing and adding value to Zimbabwe Music Awards.”

“I started the journey last year as an executive director. I will continue to connect Zimbabwe with the rest of the world,” said Kush.

Kush said the ZIMA awards ceremony will be announced in a fortnight.

“In a couple of weeks, we will announce the roadmap of music awards,” she said.

The outgoing CEO Sibanda pledged to render support to his successor, adding he was sure about her credentials.

“I’m glad that we have considered a culture of allowing new ideas to come in to take ZIMA to the next level. I will render a lot of support to Kush and I have much confidence in her,” said Sibanda.

“I organised virtual awards during the Covid-19 era as an attempt to ensure continuity of our annual programmes. It was quite challenging to take a risk under such circumstances,” said Sibanda.

During his tenure, Sibanda facilitated the acquisition of proper accommodation for the late Chimurenga music guru Dick Chingaira, who was affectionately known as Cde Chinx Chingaira.

All is set for afro-fusion-jazz artist, Aggabu Nyabinde’s album launch tonight at the 7Arts Theatre in Avondale.

The album, titled ‘Honai’, is a testimony of his life and how he has grown in the music industry.

‘Honai’ has 11 tracks, with three songs dedicated to his late father, Bob ‘The Headmaster’ Nyabinde.

In an interview with Agga, he said the stage is set for the album launch, adding that he is happy with the endorsements and support he is getting from fellow artistes and fans.

“The day has finally come and I am happy that the album is ready. All roads lead to Avondale tonight, I chose to host the album launch this Tuesday because tomorrow is a holiday, therefore people will be relaxed. I encourage my fans to come and witness the launch of this grand album,” he said.

Agga said the three songs dedicated to his late father remind him of the time he spent with his father.

“This album is sentimental as it is the first time I am performing without my father, that’s why l have dedicated three songs to him. The songs are ‘Garai Neni’, ‘Samatenga’ and ‘Chisingaurayi’.

“Garai Neni’ is a popular hymn that reminds me of my father. He might be gone but he is not forgotten. He taught me all that I know. My brother Albert fronts this track.

“Samatenga’ is a rendition of the late great Simon Chimbetu. Sulumani Chimbetu gave me the nod to redo the song. No copyright infringements were made, I sat down with Mukoma Sulu and he gave me the green light. On that song, l featured a rising gospel musician, Denzel Malakai,” said Agga.

“Chisingaurayi’ was on my father’s list, unfortunately he was taken away too soon. I lovethis song. l would always jokingly ask him to sell it to me as I wanted to be a huge part of it. By doing this song, l am honouring his wish. He wanted me to sing the song someday,” he said.

“This is the first album I am doing without my father. To me, it is to say, “Baba, I made it. Look at your son,” he said.

Agga added that the album has various collaborations from different artistes, including Mbeu, Selmor Mtukudzi and Denzel Malakai.

“I did collaborations with different rising artists, including my band members, to also give them a chance to showcase their talent,” said the musician.

The title track ‘Honai’ is a collaboration with Mbeu done after a public plea for the due to work together.

Both of them were nurtured at Pakare Paye Arts Centre.

“I recorded my first album with Mono Mkundu and then took it to Dr Oliver Mtukudzi. He bluntly told me that it was a rushed project. It was a bitter pill for me to swallow but now I understand what he meant. Like fine wine, I have matured,” recounted Agga.

In 2020, Agga was nominated for the ZIMAs in the best traditional music category. The following year, he was nominated in the best Afro-jazz category. ln 2022, Aggathen scooped an award for the best Afro-jazz musician.

“This award is special to me because it is the same accolade my father won in 2004. Eighteen years later, I won it too,” said Agga.

Pieces of sculpture are there to effectively tell world stories in visuals, hence they are moralistic and didactic. 

Their influence must never be underrated and society at large does not stop casting eyes gazing at pieces of art, and deducing messages.

Award-winning sculptor Stanley Mutanga is designing and carving artefacts to encourage women to be screened early for breast cancer, which has become a new trajectory. 

Mutanga says he has been driven by the rate at which the disease is killing women. 

“I changed my imagination after realising that most women are dying as a result of cancer. My carvings are sending a message to the people, especially women and girls to go and get tested early for breast cancer at a stage where it is still controllable,” said Mutanga. 

Mutanga who is based in Tafara, returned home from Canada recently and was disheartened by stories of mothers losing their lives to breast cancer. 

“I want to ensure that the message is understood and is taken seriously, cancer is a dangerous disease that can be treated if screened early. The earlier breast cancer is detected, the better your chance of survival. 

“Early detection of breast cancer may mean less treatment and less time spent recovering. Most breast cancers are harmful and should be detected and treated as early as possible,” said Mutanga. Mutanga who was born in Murehwa and relocated to Harare in search of lucrative sculpting deals, highlights in some of his pieces, some of the measures that can reduce breast cancer. 

One of his pieces shows a mother breastfeeding her child as another way of reducing the chances of having the ailment.

“Breastfeeding can also lower a mother’s risk of breast and ovarian cancers. A recent study found that only about 1 in 4 people think that a woman is less likely to develop breast cancer later in life if she breastfeeds. 

It’s important to know that breastfeeding helps not only the baby’s health but also the mother’s health. In light of this I have some works that are depicting this,” he said. 

Tafara and Mabvuku have become a hive of sculpture activities with seasoned and those who are still under tutelage. 

Mutanga said he had nurtured at least 20 students who are making headways to occupy the arts space. Mutanga won a National Arts Merit Award (NAMA) and in 2019 was awarded for being the best 3 Dimension (3D) artist. 

He said when doing his work, he depicts everyday issues and occurrences. 

“Last summer I was invited to Gunguwo Art Farm in Canada. Some of my works are displayed in workshops in Kingston Canada. 

The sculpture which was voted the best that year is titled “Tribute to Mother of all Generations” When doing my work, I convey messages about things that I see every day. I also depict some everyday occurrences that affect people’s lives which include romance, culture, and nature as well. My current works are Under My Wing, Sweet Mother, and Mother Of Generations,” he said. 

 Mutanga said, apart from visiting his studio in Tafara, fans can also find his work on his Facebook page under S.Mutanga Sculptures, and on Instagram@wembizi as well as on his X account at Tweeter@stanley_mutanga.

He said it is important to embrace the arts industry by building more centres to make it more accessible. 

“I spent over thirty years in the arts. I think there is a need to build more art centres and embrace them through organising workshops to teach the succeeding generations about sculpting,” he said.

The Government is currently working flat-out to provide more centres for cancer screening.",https://www.herald.co.zw/sculpture-to-promote-early-breast-cancer-screening/,The Herald,Sculpture to promote early breast cancer screening,,2

Organisers of the Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2024 on Saturday revealed the final list of participants expected to take part in the pageant, as the show draws nearer.

A bevy of 20 beauties was trimmed from the initial list of 32 after fans voted, with subsequent interviews being carried by the organisers of the pageant.

The pageant will be held on May 18 at Harare’s Hippodrome Auditorium.

The 20 are Amanda Peresu (Bulawayo), Lompopoma Khumalo (Bulawayo), Sakhile Dube (Bulawayo), Stacey Hall (Bulawayo), Wendy Ndlovu (Bulawayo), Victoria Shoko (Bulawayo), Nozinhle Gumede (Bulawayo), Monalisa Kandava (Chinhoyi), Lisa Sibanda (Chitungwiza), Shelly Uzogba (Gweru), Pauline Marere (Masvingo), Natasha Njomboro (Harare), Hannah Brits (Harare), Letwin Chinomona (Harare), Melissa Vanham (Harare), Alisa Adams (Harare), Shelly Bent (Harare), Jessie Marisa (Harare), Tanyaradzwa Muparutsa (Harare) and Samantha Chikwanda (Mutare).

The finalists will go for a boot camp to prepare to strut their stuff on the ramp on May 18, where one of them will be crowned Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2024.

The winner will walk away with a car and cash prize. She will represent the country at the Miss Universe pageant scheduled for September 28 in Mexico.

In an interview, the pageant licence holder and national director, Tendai Hunda, said selecting the 20 finalists was a mammoth task as all the 32 girls were good in terms of talent and presentation. She said a team of judges selected the 20 with the help of the organising team.

“This year we managed to get, high-quality girls, who include those already beauty queens in their own right, title holders and commercial models,” she said.

“Our team had a tough time selecting the best 20, as all the 32 who had qualified put up a scintillating act. They did their interviews and project presentation, which was amazing. However, we wanted 20 girls who will then vie for the coveted title come May 18.”

Hunda, a former model, said they wanted 18 finalists but because of fan votes, they ended up having 20.

“We had fans voting for their favourite contestants to be on the finalists and there were two girls who had the highest marks, Pauline Marere and Wendy Ndlovu.”

“They then automatically qualified to be in the running. Again, during the selection process, the “Voice for Change” challenge was the toughest one and we are happy the girls managed to sail through,” she said.

She said that on May 11 they are conducting the official photo shoot with the girls. Preliminary judging will be done six days before the final event.

Asked about any international guests coming to grace the event, Hunda said they have sent some invites to some regional celebrities and established models.

“I will furnish you with details but we have a lot of surprises. This year is bigger and better, as we also have roped in some of the special taskforce team to push the brand of Miss Universe Zimbabwe,” she said.

Last year’s winner was Brooke Bruk Jackson, who represented the country at the 72nd Miss Universe pageant in El Salvador and finished in the top 10 Miss Universe 2023 Voice for Change Silver Finalists.

The Voice for Change Silver Finalist was about representing a global shifting tapestry of voices committed to making a difference.

She was selected together with Angola, Brazil, Chile, Lebanon, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa and Ukraine.

The finalists captured the audience’s attention and demonstrated a passion for positive change through their impactful advocacy videos. The competition went beyond traditional beauty pageant norms, allowing viewers to play an active role in shaping the outcome.

The just-ended concert by sungura doyen Alick Macheso in Chitungwiza, dubbed “Homecoming Show”, held at the Aquatic Complex on Saturday night was a clear testimony that there is no rivalry between him and Mark Ngwazi or any other artiste.

It can also be dubbed the reconciliation gig, after two of the country’s musicians, Ngwazi and Peter Moyo, reunited with their siblings, ending years of rivalry. Macheso also lifted the ban on his dancer, Selemani “Majuice” Mpochi.

The concert featured the likes of Mark and Tindo Ngwazi, Nicholas Zakaria, Peter Moyo, Tongai Obert Moyo and Macheso’s two sons, Esau and Tatenda.

The Aquatic Complex was filled and revellers were charmed to see Macheso performing alongside Mark Ngwazi.

In an interview with The Herald Entertainment, before the show started, Macheso dispelled rumours that he hates Ngwazi.

“Those are lies that I hate Mark Ngwazi. People can say whatever they want but I will never hate anyone in our industry.

“I like what he is doing, that is why I have decided to call him to be part of us at this concert,” he said.

About two years back, Ngwazi and Macheso released their albums namely “Nharo Nezvine Nharo” and “Tinosvitswa Nashe” in the same month respectively.

The release generated interest on social media platforms with some fans suggesting that Ngwazi intended to fight Baba Shero.

This time around, Macheso is set to release his 13th album on June 7 and Mark Ngwazi is releasing his seventh album, three weeks later on June 29.

Macheso added that he had no problem with that, saying competition in sungura was necessary so that the genre can withstand the massive competition from other genres like Zim Hip-Hop, Zimdancehall, and many more.

Ngwazi also opened up about his cordial relationship with Baba Shero.

He said that Baba Shero is his mentor and on many occasions he visits him for advice.",https://www.herald.co.zw/machesos-homecoming-show-turns-into-reconciliation-concert/,The Herald,Macheso’s ‘Homecoming Show’ turns into reconciliation concert,,2

Organisers of the much-publicised speech competition dubbed, ‘Possible Speech Contest’ have said that the stage is set for the challenge which will see 25 children and youth taking part.

Scheduled to take place on May 1 at Harare Girls High School, the event will be hosted by International Youth Fellowship (IYF) in partnership with the City of Harare.

The competition will have 13-20 year-olds participating with each speaker getting not more than four minutes on selected topics.

Some of the topics on the programme include: ‘My Dream’-(The world I hope for in 10 years), ‘Touching Moments — (Happy and unforgettable moments), ‘A person I admire’, ‘Mental health awareness’ and ‘The youth drug problem and the role I play’.

The deadline for participants to have submitted their scripts has passed and organisers confirmed that they already have some which are now being marked.

In an interview with IYF country director Kyeongchan Yang Simon from Korea, said the stage is set and already the participants are geared for the show.

He said registration was via social media, on Facebook.

“We have received more entries this year from various children and youths across Zimbabwe,” he said.

“The main reason for this competition is to empower them and equip  them with knowledge on particular subjects as they will also give solutions according to their mindset, guided by us.

“This will also eradicate some of the social ills by our children in the community as they will be busy with what is important to their mental health.”

He said participants will walk away with certificates and hampers sponsored by their partners and corporates.

Mr Simon said officials from the Ministries of Education and Arts will be attending the event.

Meanwhile, the chairman and president of IYF Zimbabwe Professor James Shim has shared his solidarity message ahead of the competition. He encouraged the youngsters to be vigilant all the time.“People believe what they see and hear. They make judgements and decisions based on that. But when we don’t think deeply, we make wrong judgements and decisions,” he said.

“Because we often fall into illusions. Now, when the Japanese were looking at a map of Korea during the period of colonisation, they said: “It’s like a rabbit cowering”.

It was part of their brainwashing that you are weak and need protection of Japan. But if you look at it differently, it’s a strong tiger.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/all-set-for-speech-contest/,The Herald,All set for ‘Speech Contest’,,2

President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

“The Zimbabwean workers are victims of these illegal sanctions and today we want to give them solidarity. Our message to all the oppressed people and the workers in the world is we salute you.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/workers-efforts-hailed/,The Herald,Workers’ efforts hailed,,0

Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has exposed 11 cases of fake doctors this year alone, as people take advantage of the vastness of the country’s largest referral medical institution to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central Business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,Prof Munjeri gets State-assisted funeral,,0

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

“I don’t want to appear like we want to reverse the brain drain, but let those who train in Zambia remain in Zambia and those we train remain here.",https://www.herald.co.zw/health-workforce-to-double-by-2028/,The Herald,,,0

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic Business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and Business organisations will be held during the Business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

123,Politics,"May Day may be a fairly quiet holiday but it is a very important one as it concentrates minds on the position of workers within the economy and the need to ensure that their contribution is recognised.

Their rights and expectations are also taken into account.

President Mnangagwa set the tone with his statement on the eve of the public holiday, that the workers are an essential part of the economic growth through their production and productivity, and their importance cannot be minimised. Without the workers there is no production and they are entitled to their fair share of the wealth their efforts produce.

The Government is the largest employer, and runs almost all the essential services that the rest of us need to produce and to work, so as Head of Government he renewed his commitment that conditions of service will be continually improved within the State sector.

There are obvious limits to just how fast remuneration can be raised and the non-monetary benefits can be implemented and increased. We are not going to print money, or even borrow money, to pay civil servants more since that just leads to economic challenges.

But as the economy grows the tax revenue grows and so more can be done each year to improve the conditions of State workers. The Government, within its fiscal discipline that is now so essential, has maintained the percentage of revenue spent on staff, and maintained it as the largest item in the budget, so economic growth automatically means more can be spent.

The commitment by the President not to take State workers for granted and to maintain the policy of continual improvement as the economy grows is, therefore, important. He recognises their essential input and he wants to treat them fairly.

The President also made his appeal to the private sector, which employs considerably more people than the State, even with the growth of self-employment, to again follow a similar policy of continual improvement and making sure that workers are treated fairly and get their fair share of the wealth being created. Again this is the result of a growing economy, growing production and growing investment.

A major plank of President Mnangagwa’s policy is the Vision 2030, pushing Zimbabwe upwards into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. That is not just a mantra, since we have to think about what that journey means.

The only way to have a successful and continuous increase in national wealth is to make sure that everyone benefits.

That in turn increases growth. Even the arch-capitalist Henry Ford grabbed that point early on as he introduced mass production of motor cars. He worked out that he was not going to succeed unless his own very large workforce could afford to buy the cars they made, so he raised wages and was able to pay these through the higher productivity his assembly lines generated as well as the growing stream of revenue from his growing sales. Everything worked together.

The growing number of the self-employed win as well when employers are fair. Those civil servants and private-sector workers spend the money they earn, and spend quite a lot of it on the goods and services that the self-employed provide. So they win and the whole nation together moves forward. In any case, the small Businesses become larger and start hiring people, so they need to remember that they must pay their new workers their just dues.

The Government follows this policy by using the small-scale farming sectors to drive rural development. The whole policy is based on the premise that converting subsistence farmers into small commercial farmers creates the wealth that drives rural industrialisation and the growing percentage of rural dwellers who provide the goods and services that the farmers require and want.

In a developed economy a huge majority of rural dwellers are not farmers, but the underlying rural economy is based on farm production, so the Second Republic rural development policy is based on fact and functional theory, not on some pipedream. Vision 2030 is based on the need for the people, as well as the national economy, to be upper middle income.

While the Second Republic has streamlined labour law, to make it easier to understand and implement, it has retained the essential core that workers and employees are human beings who have rights, as well as duties, and has retained the whole gamut of the national employment councils and workers committees that have been so effective in ensuring that employers and employees can negotiate properly and equally. It has strengthened the similar system in State service, so there is a joint negotiating forum.

The national employment councils were created in settler days to benefit the white workers. They were partially extended under the more liberal settler regime of the late 1950s to more of the formal sector, but only started flourishing fully after independence when everyone was included fully in spirit as well as law.

But they need to be used. Some sectors have very strong and effective NECs and not only do employees benefit, but employers have found that they also benefit by having agreements that work and so can be factored into operations. So they make sure that proper and accurate data is available and enforce the NEC decisions.

Some sectors have very weak NECs, the commercial workers especially, and both employers and employees need to upgrade these.  Sometimes past splits give rise to the oddity that workers in the same sector, and even under the same employer, fall under different NECs. Combining them so that the strongest and best represents all workers in a sector makes sense, for both sides.

Labour law is there to create the practical conditions that President Mnangagwa spoke so strongly about, the need for employers and employees to be fair, and for workers to receive their just share of the growing wealth and basically to ensure that workers who fulfil their duties conscientiously are not treated as cogs in a machine but as co-creators of that extra wealth.",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-drivers-of-the-economy-need-recognition-fair-remuneration/,The Herald,,,0

President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

“The Zimbabwean workers are victims of these illegal sanctions and today we want to give them solidarity. Our message to all the oppressed people and the workers in the world is we salute you.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/workers-efforts-hailed/,The Herald,Workers’ efforts hailed,,0

Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has exposed 11 cases of fake doctors this year alone, as people take advantage of the vastness of the country’s largest referral medical institution to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central Business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

He has since appeared in court.",https://www.herald.co.zw/pari-exposes-11-fake-doctors-in-4-months/,The Herald,Pari exposes 11 fake doctors in 4 months,,0

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,Prof Munjeri gets State-assisted funeral,,0

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

“I don’t want to appear like we want to reverse the brain drain, but let those who train in Zambia remain in Zambia and those we train remain here.",https://www.herald.co.zw/health-workforce-to-double-by-2028/,The Herald,Health workforce to double by 2028,,0

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic Business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and Business organisations will be held during the Business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

IRAN has offered 1 000 educational scholarships for Zimbabweans with the first batch of students, likely to be lecturers from polytechnics and industrial colleges, undergoing six-month courses as trainers of trainers, set to start their studies before year end.

The beneficiaries and areas of study will be informed by the need to bridge the human resources gap identified by the Government initiated skills gap audit of 2018.

The offer comes after Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga recently led Zimbabwe’s participation at the second Iran-Africa International Economic Conference.

Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Permanent Secretary Professor Fanuel Tagwira said the programme would target staff from the polytechnics and industrial colleges.

“We believe in action. We believe in implementation and we have learnt a lot since coming here. Clearly there are a number of things that have happened. With the partnership we now have with Iran, they have offered us 1 000 scholarships for our education.

“We sat down and went through their training centre and we saw what they are providing and as we go home, we are going to mobilise so that we can send the first batch of our teachers who are in polytechnics and industrial colleges to come here and acquire skills for a period of six months then they will become trainers.

“This is a training of trainers and for each discipline, we will send a batch of 12 people to make a full class so that they can teach them in English and they will acquire the skills and after six months they go back and train others, said Prof Tagwira.

The programme was ready to roll out and the two parties had agreed on the implementation modalities and timelines.

“We have met with their ministry of science and technology and innovation and as we discussed with them, we already have a memorandum of understanding with them and they are saying let’s move. Our first step is establishing a steering committee that will be responsible for agreeing on the programmes that we want to work on.”

The Ministry of Information, Publicity, and Broadcasting Services has come up with a communication plan to aid the Reserve Bank in raising awareness of the new gold-backed ZiG currency introduced last month.

While the ZiG existed from the second week of last month in bank accounts and electronic transfers, notes and coins of the ZiG were released to the market on Tuesday, bringing relief to the transacting public who were facing difficulties in accessing small change.

In a statement yesterday Permanent Secretary for Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Mr Nick Mangwana said the Ministry was using communication channels, such as radio, television, newspapers, and social media, to educate the public about the advantages of using gold as a currency, such as its stability and value retention.

“To achieve this mandate, the ministry is using its spread of district information officers and provincial information officers to reach the citizens in rural and urban areas.

“In addition to the Ministry’s information ecosystem, it is also working with key stakeholders, such as financial institutions and Businesses, to encourage the adoption of gold as a means of exchange.

“Additionally, the ministry will be coordinating events, such as workshops and conferences, to engage with the public and address any concerns or misconceptions about using gold as a currency.

“By effectively communicating the benefits and possibilities of using gold as a currency, the Ministry of Information, Publicity, and Broadcasting Services will help generate support and momentum for the gold currency publicity campaign in Zimbabwe,” he said.

Mr Mangwana said the communication plan sought to ensure that the purpose, benefits, and features of the new currency were clearly understood by the target audience.

The communication plan was helping the team to undertake five key issues: creating awareness, providing information, addressing concerns, building trust and encouraging adoption.

“The communication plan will be instrumental in creating awareness among the citizens about the introduction of the ZiG. Through various communication channels such as media, social media, and public events, the plan will ensure that the citizens are informed about the new currency and its benefits.

“The communication plan is providing detailed information about the Zimbabwe Gold currency, including how it works, its value, and how citizens can exchange their existing currency for the new currency. This will help to dispel any confusion or misinformation surrounding the new currency.

“The communication plan is addressing any concerns or questions that citizens may have about the introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold currency. By providing clear and accurate information, the plan will help to alleviate any doubts or fears that the citizens may have,” he said.

“Effective communication is crucial in building trust between the Government and the citizens. The communication plan ensures transparency and openness in the communication process, which helps to build trust and confidence in the new currency.

“The communication plan is aiming to encourage citizens to adopt the Zimbabwe Gold Currency and use it in their daily transactions. By highlighting the benefits of the new currency, such as stability and security, the plan will incentivise citizens to embrace the new currency.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/ministry-partners-rbz-in-currency-awareness/,The Herald,Ministry partners RBZ in currency awareness,,0

Government has intensified the fight against livestock mortality by constructing water troughs at the village Business units, hay baling, and drought mitigation awareness campaigns.

It has also embarked on a nationwide borehole drilling exercise to save the lives of both livestock and people.

The Government is also upscaling hay baling programmes, where five million hay bales are expected to be produced this season and water is also distributed in areas where livestock is most vulnerable.

To date, private players and the Government have so far produced 1 223 674 hay bales and last season a total of 4 803 133 hay bales were produced.

The Agriculture and Rural Development Advisory Service (ARDAS)indicates that the Government is constructing troughs at borehole sites adding that it is currently mobilising water bowsers for strategic areas.

“Drought mitigation awareness campaigns are underway. This involves the use of pamphlets, use of electronic and print media.

“Drilling of boreholes is underway and piping of water from dams to strategic areas is recommended.

“Modalities for expediting the procurement process of the requirements for hay baling are underway. In the previous hay bailing of 2023, a total of 4,8 million were produced and these need to be mobilised as a strategic supplementary feeding,” said the department.

Farmers are encouraged to destock. This involves reducing the number of animal stock during the drought. Non-productive stock is selected, finished off, and sold, and the returns can be used to purchase feed to save the productive herd.

Destocking reduces the demand for fodder & grazing.

Disposal and removal of diseased animals will reduce the potential for environmental and health challenges.

Destocking also helps create links with traders in remote areas, where they may not naturally have reached.

Financing of traders to support destocking is also important and facilitation of increased offtake through removal of trade and marketing barriers.

Livestock vaccinations are also recommended this period to mitigate the spread of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) during movement of livestock from FMD zones into national parks.

Grazing of livestock too close to the ground and indiscriminate feeding patterns common during drought periods will expose them to diseases such as Anthrax, Blackleg, Botulism, and Hardware disease.

Increased activity at the human-livestock-wildlife interface will likely result in rabies virus spill-over to humans and domestic animals hence the need to vaccinate against these diseases

Farmers are encouraged to implement management practices such as providing ample shade and access to cool water, and adjusting feeding schedules can help minimise the impact of heat on cattle health and welfare.

They are also encouraged to establish dedicated fodder plots and provide cattle with adequate water.

Farmers are urged to downscale some livestock and procure feed adding that there is a need to practice good husbandry practises.

Acting chief director at the Veterinary Services Department Dr Pious Makaya said livestock condition is not bad adding that borehole drilling and hay bailing are critical components that need to be scaled up this period.

“Grazing is limited in winter due to the effects of climate change so various strategies were put in place by the Government to ensure that our livestock do not suffer from drought,” he said.

Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union (ZCFU) president Dr Shadreck Makombe said farmers should consider the long-term sustainability of the pasture and not exceed its carrying capacity.

There is a need to reduce the stocking rate by either selling less productive animals or moving them to alternative grazing areas.

The situation will reduce pressure on the pasture and ensure that there is enough forage for the remaining animals, he said.

Recently, Livestock Farmers Union chairman Sifiso Sibanda said farmers may need to safeguard their livestock this coming season by adjusting herd sizes and stocking rates to prevent overgrazing and reduce the risk of livestock losses due to feed shortages.

Government was concerned with the level of performance of the livestock sector and it promulgated a blueprint to address all areas that were limiting growth",https://www.herald.co.zw/fight-to-reduce-livestock-deaths-accelerated/,The Herald,Fight to reduce livestock deaths accelerated,,0

ENNISMORE, a creative hospitality company which operates the Mondrian Hotels brand across the world, is looking into establishing a five-star hotel in Zimbabwe as part of its expansion drive into the African continent.

With properties in Cannes, Mexico City, Ibiza, Florida, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Doha, Seoul, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shoreditch London, the brand is on track to establish its footprint in Zimbabwe.

Mondrian Hotels and Residences is part of Ennismore, a creative hospitality company rooted in culture and community, with a global collective of entrepreneurial and founder-built brands with purpose at their heart.

Formed in 2021, Ennismore is a joint venture with Accor, which holds a majority shareholding.

In an interview at Mondrian Seoul Itaewon, general manager Mr Damien Marchenay said as a global leader in the hotel industry, they were planning on expanding to Zimbabwe.

“The Mondrian Brand was born 30 years ago in Los Angeles, United States from one guy called Jan Schager and he loved Mondrian as a painter,” he said.

“He then created the brand from this painting (Mondrian) so a lot of colourful, lot of animations and then we translate it here in Seoul as a lot of K-pop. Mondrian became a wonderful brand that could be expanded everywhere and we hope in Africa and we hope in Zimbabwe.

“We look for partners everywhere in the world and then we think that a lot of different countries will fit very well in the brand.

“Definitely Zimbabwe will be one because this is a country where you have got a lot of different things that you can bring to the brand tourism, but not only tourism, economic growth and everything.”

Mr Marchenay said it will be good to get a Mondrian in Zimbabwe as part of their expansion drive to Africa.

“So if we open a Mondrian in Zimbabwe which I hope we do obviously when we build a hotel we are trying to be really big partners of the vicinity and then we really try give the local and international feeling.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/mondrian-hotels-target-local-market/,The Herald,Mondrian Hotels target local market,,0

Online sites allowing hate speech and cyberbullying will be put out of reach, the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) has promised as it will soon lead an uncompromising fight against serious perpetrators of these menaces.

Director general of Potraz Dr Gift Machengete told participants recently at the launch of findings of a Child Online Safety Survey carried out by Potraz, in collaboration with Research Council of Zimbabwe and the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, that peddling hate speech and cyberbullying now warranted special attention as it was now rife.

“Cyberbullying and hate speech is quite rampant these days on X (formerly Twitter). Cyberbullying on X is now unbearable. It cannot be allowed to continue.

“At the regulatory level, as Potraz, we are doing something about this. We are worried about the safety of our children online. We will make sure that these illicit sites are out of reach. We are supposed to use the internet productively,” he said.

“The sites are going to be out of reach so that we control the content. We will be taking action under the Data Protection Act. We now have the technology to hunt for those who use pseudo names peddling sexual content, cyber bullying and hate speech. We want to put a stop on hate speech and cyber bullying.”

In 2021, Zimbabwe enacted a cyber and data protection law to protect citizens” privacy and curb internet abuse.

Potraz is mandated to set up and enforcing the rules for data collection, protection, storage and presentation.

The Cyber and Data Protection Act ensures that individuals have better control over their personal information and that this information is processed for a legitimate purpose and in a lawful, fair and transparent manner.

Potraz now has a telecommunications traffic monitoring system to track mobile phone traffic in real-time to monitor the revenue operators generate.

Technology experts say cyberbullying has become a prevalent issue within Zimbabwe and the African digital space with many users being bullied because of their opinions, facial looks and associations.

They say cyberbullying leads to depression, infringement on freedom of expression and association, loss of self-esteem and death on some occasions.

One in three young people in 30 countries said they have been a victim of online bullying, with one in five reporting having skipped school due to cyberbullying and violence, according to a 2019 Unicef poll.

The growing use of digital technologies has led to the rise of cyberbullying, the deluge of racist posts on X and the pervasive atmosphere of social hatred.

Experts say the effects of hate speech are wide-ranging – direct assaults, such as threats or harassment, can harm a person’s psychological well-being and emotional stability, while indirect assaults can undermine their reputation and dignity.",https://www.herald.co.zw/potraz-moves-to-combat-cyberbullying-hate-speech/,The Herald,"Potraz moves to combat cyberbullying, hate speech",,0

THE Government’s completion of a staff village comprising 220 houses for civil servants and other State employees assigned to the Beitbridge Border Post has boosted staff morale, resulting in improved border efficiency.

Staff from agencies such as the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra), the Department of Immigration as well as Government ministries and security arms have taken occupancy of the houses.

Zimborders Consortium, in partnership with the Government, built the staff village some 7km east of the border town under a 17 and half year public private partnership.

In addition, 28 more F14 houses were allocated in the north of the town to civil servants.

“We commend this milestone move by our Government to address accommodation challenges for its workers. The completion of this project has accommodated those that were exposed to high rentals by landlords, usually paying in South African rands),” said the District Development Coordinator, Mrs Sikhangezile Mafu-Moyo.

“The new staff village has reduced congestion for those that were sharing the few available houses with their workmates.

“Morale of the workers has improved and this is translating to improved service delivery at the same time ensuring the full implementation of the various Government policies and obligations.”

The new staff village has 20 Type A houses for heads of departments with three bedrooms detached units and (Type B) 20 others with three bedrooms and are semi-detached.

The remaining (Type C) 180 units are high-rise flats with two bedrooms which are being shared by a total of 180 junior staff members.

The houses were built in the form of a gated complex with an independent sewer system comprising a bio-digester.

In addition, the housing complex has a clubhouse with a swimming pool, braai area, and numerous playing areas for children among other social amenities.

“On the development side, the staff village has improved the quality of infrastructure in our district. It also reduced the national housing waiting list and reduced pressure from civil servants inquiring about accommodation,” said Mrs Mafu-Moyo.

Regional immigration officer in-charge of Beitbridge, Mr Joshua Chibundu said the availability of more housing units had enabled the department to deploy adequate workers to clear traffic through the three border terminals for freight, buses and the one handling light cars and pedestrians.

“The housing project has brought joy to the officers who were previously sharing accommodation, depriving them of the much needed rest after a day’s hard work,” said Mr Chibundu.

“We recently received additional manpower and the houses brought us much relief because we were not going to accommodate them if the village had not been opened for occupation. We now have a full complement of officers deployed at Beitbridge”.

In January, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube commissioned a block of flats built for Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) workers deployed to Beitbridge.

Zanu PF youths have invested more than US$1 million in constructing more than 80 market stalls at Njere Complex in Mbare, which are expected to benefit thousands of young people, in line with Government’s economic empowerment drive that seeks to attain an upper middle class economy by 2030.

The project is also expected to benefit several downstream enterprises through job creation and other Business activities. The stalls are almost at roof level and each of them is expected to accommodate at least five people directly.

Ward 4 Councillor Boniface Maburuse said they had converted Njere dumpsite into market stalls to create employment for youths and help combat cholera.

The dumpsite was an eyesore with vendors operating close to the site.

Clr Maburuse said: “I was approached by the youths who wanted to invest in small to medium enterprises. I assisted them to get the required paperwork and they followed all the procedures required to establish market stall at the site.  We are happy they are almost complete with some of the structures ready for occupation,” said Clr Maburuse.

Secretary for Ward 4 Development Community Cde Munyaradzi Chitenderere said they were constructing a million-dollar project meant to transform Njere complex in Mbare into a smart market mall.

THE Zimbabwe Union of Journalists wants a single National Employment Council (NEC) for the whole media industry to address working conditions of all journalists.

At present newspaper journalists fall under a NEC that includes all other staff in the newspaper, printing and packaging industry and was an extension of the former NEC that represented printers, taking over from the NEC for the Commercial Undertaking of Zimbabwe responsible for journalists and commercial staff.

In a statement to mark Workers Day that is observed on May 1 annually, ZUJ president Mr George Maponga bemoaned working conditions for journalists, which he said do not compare with other sectors whose remuneration is sustainable.

“We are celebrating Workers Day at a time when the situation is not all rosy in the media industry.

“The role of the media is to educate, entertain and inform and we are exalting Government to expeditiously put in place a National Employment Council for the media industry, which will put in place a lasting solution to the poor salaries and working conditions that have condemned journalists to poverty,” he said.

“Today, we join the rest of the world in marking Workers Day when our tails are down because we have nothing to show for our toils every day to keep the nation informed.

“As ZUJ, we want to assure our members of our relentless pursuit of justice for all so that they are remunerated what is commensurate to their work.”

Mr Maponga said ZUJ will continue to push authorities to make sure that the NEC for the media industry sees the light of the day.

He added that it was disheartening to see that when the rest of the nation is moving ahead with the mantra ‘leaving no one and no place behind’, the media industry found itself behind other sectors in terms of remuneration and salaries.

“We hope ongoing engagements by the ZUJ will result in the creation and birth of a new epoch where journalists are recognised accordingly for their efforts so that at the end of the day they can compare favourably with other sectors in Zimbabwe and beyond.

“I want to assure you that all hope is not lost.

“We will continue fighting for what is rightly ours and we hope in the fullness of time professional journalism will return to its long lost lustre,” said Mr Maponga.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zuj-mulls-single-nec-for-sector/,The Herald,ZUJ mulls single NEC for sector,,0

Telecommunications and technology giant, Econet Wireless, has unveiled two free remittance corridors into the country, completely eliminating the cost to both senders and receivers of foreign currency, marking a first for Africa.

Econet partnered with its sister company, Sasai Money Transfer, to enable individuals and companies in the United Kingdom and South Africa to send money into Zimbabwe free of charge, starting today.

This initiative not only abolishes fees for senders but also ensures that recipients can cash out from their EcoCash wallets without incurring any charges.

With international remittances typically burdened by fees of up to 15 percent for senders and 3 percent for recipients upon cash out, Econet’s bold step is aimed at extending a lifeline to Zimbabweans.

Econet Wireless Zimbabwe chief executive officer Dr Douglas Mboweni said: “We hope Zimbabweans in the Diaspora will use the savings to send more money home to their families,” Dr Mboweni said.

“The majority of remittances to Zimbabwe are conducted through these two main corridors (the UK and South Africa). We don’t have to pay any third parties on those corridors, because we rely on a sister company in the group, which agreed to help out,” he said.

The Econet CEO said he hoped the move by Econet would encourage other companies facilitating remittances into Zimbabwe to reduce their fees, noting that it was time that remittances into Africa in general were brought down to assist with the continent’s economic development agenda.

Dr Mboweni added that the initiative was in support of the Government efforts to increase diaspora remittances coming into the country through formal channels.

Econet’s extensive EcoCash agent network ensures that even people in remote rural areas have access to low-cost financial services, reducing the need for recipients to travel long distances to collect cash.",https://www.herald.co.zw/econet-removes-charges-on-forex-remittances/,The Herald,Econet removes charges on forex remittances,,0

President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

“The Zimbabwean workers are victims of these illegal sanctions and today we want to give them solidarity. Our message to all the oppressed people and the workers in the world is we salute you.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/workers-efforts-hailed/,The Herald,Workers’ efforts hailed,,1

Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has exposed 11 cases of fake doctors this year alone, as people take advantage of the vastness of the country’s largest referral medical institution to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central Business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,,,1

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic Business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and Business organisations will be held during the Business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

The Second Republic’s engagement and re-engagement policy has seen Western countries warm up relations with Zimbabwe, a significant milestone in the country’s foreign policy agenda.",https://www.herald.co.zw/minister-shava-attends-nordic-africa-meeting/,The Herald,,,1

The late national hero and leader of the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa (ZAOGA), Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, was a visionary leader who valued the empowerment of children through education, Information and Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingimuzi Phuti said this week.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Ezekiel Guti Christian Primary School in Riverside, Chitungwiza, after touring the school as part of preparations for the Ezekiel Guti Day to be commemorated on Saturday, he said: “I am humbled by the vision of our departed hero, Baba Guti, the vision that put the concerns of a human being to reality, the vision that foresaw things that we are beginning to discover today, the importance of taking a child to school, the knowledge that it doesn’t have to be the responsibility of Government alone.

“It’s the responsibility that is more entangled with care and understanding the reason to empower somebody through education that drove him. But apart from that we are really touched by the ahead of time kind of man he was,” he said.

Deputy Minister Phuti said the programme was meant to celebrate the life of an illustrious son of Zimbabwe whose visionary leadership was noticeable not only in Zimbabwe alone but impacted lives around the world.

The ministry has partnered the Ezekiel Guti Primary School to train youths in the use of ICT.

“In honour of the legacy of Baba Guti we decided that we come in with our digital relevance hence that training we have organised in partnership with your administration.

“We hope that the training will not only open up the eyes of our youngsters but will motivate them to pursue other relevant skills from this,” he said.

Archbishop Guti’s widow, Apostle Eunor Guti expressed her gratitude to the Ministry for the partnership.

“I would like to thank the Ministry of ICT for partnering with us and joining the Zaoga family as we celebrate the life and legacy of our father, Professor Guti,” she said.

Apart from schools the Archbishop Professor Guti also established the Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University in Bindura.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zaogas-ict-vision-impressive/,The Herald,,,1
145,Sports,"May Day may be a fairly quiet holiday but it is a very important one as it concentrates minds on the position of workers within the economy and the need to ensure that their contribution is recognised.

Their rights and expectations are also taken into account.

President Mnangagwa set the tone with his statement on the eve of the public holiday, that the workers are an essential part of the economic growth through their production and productivity, and their importance cannot be minimised. Without the workers there is no production and they are entitled to their fair share of the wealth their efforts produce.

The Government is the largest employer, and runs almost all the essential services that the rest of us need to produce and to work, so as Head of Government he renewed his commitment that conditions of service will be continually improved within the State sector.

There are obvious limits to just how fast remuneration can be raised and the non-monetary benefits can be implemented and increased. We are not going to print money, or even borrow money, to pay civil servants more since that just leads to economic challenges.

But as the economy grows the tax revenue grows and so more can be done each year to improve the conditions of State workers. The Government, within its fiscal discipline that is now so essential, has maintained the percentage of revenue spent on staff, and maintained it as the largest item in the budget, so economic growth automatically means more can be spent.

The commitment by the President not to take State workers for granted and to maintain the policy of continual improvement as the economy grows is, therefore, important. He recognises their essential input and he wants to treat them fairly.

The President also made his appeal to the private sector, which employs considerably more people than the State, even with the growth of self-employment, to again follow a similar policy of continual improvement and making sure that workers are treated fairly and get their fair share of the wealth being created. Again this is the result of a growing economy, growing production and growing investment.

A major plank of President Mnangagwa’s policy is the Vision 2030, pushing Zimbabwe upwards into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. That is not just a mantra, since we have to think about what that journey means.

The only way to have a successful and continuous increase in national wealth is to make sure that everyone benefits.

That in turn increases growth. Even the arch-capitalist Henry Ford grabbed that point early on as he introduced mass production of motor cars. He worked out that he was not going to succeed unless his own very large workforce could afford to buy the cars they made, so he raised wages and was able to pay these through the higher productivity his assembly lines generated as well as the growing stream of revenue from his growing sales. Everything worked together.

The growing number of the self-employed win as well when employers are fair. Those civil servants and private-sector workers spend the money they earn, and spend quite a lot of it on the goods and services that the self-employed provide. So they win and the whole nation together moves forward. In any case, the small Businesses become larger and start hiring people, so they need to remember that they must pay their new workers their just dues.

The Government follows this policy by using the small-scale farming sectors to drive rural development. The whole policy is based on the premise that converting subsistence farmers into small commercial farmers creates the wealth that drives rural industrialisation and the growing percentage of rural dwellers who provide the goods and services that the farmers require and want.

In a developed economy a huge majority of rural dwellers are not farmers, but the underlying rural economy is based on farm production, so the Second Republic rural development policy is based on fact and functional theory, not on some pipedream. Vision 2030 is based on the need for the people, as well as the national economy, to be upper middle income.

While the Second Republic has streamlined labour law, to make it easier to understand and implement, it has retained the essential core that workers and employees are human beings who have rights, as well as duties, and has retained the whole gamut of the national employment councils and workers committees that have been so effective in ensuring that employers and employees can negotiate properly and equally. It has strengthened the similar system in State service, so there is a joint negotiating forum.

The national employment councils were created in settler days to benefit the white workers. They were partially extended under the more liberal settler regime of the late 1950s to more of the formal sector, but only started flourishing fully after independence when everyone was included fully in spirit as well as law.

But they need to be used. Some sectors have very strong and effective NECs and not only do employees benefit, but employers have found that they also benefit by having agreements that work and so can be factored into operations. So they make sure that proper and accurate data is available and enforce the NEC decisions.

Some sectors have very weak NECs, the commercial workers especially, and both employers and employees need to upgrade these.  Sometimes past splits give rise to the oddity that workers in the same sector, and even under the same employer, fall under different NECs. Combining them so that the strongest and best represents all workers in a sector makes sense, for both sides.

Labour law is there to create the practical conditions that President Mnangagwa spoke so strongly about, the need for employers and employees to be fair, and for workers to receive their just share of the growing wealth and basically to ensure that workers who fulfil their duties conscientiously are not treated as cogs in a machine but as co-creators of that extra wealth.",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-drivers-of-the-economy-need-recognition-fair-remuneration/,The Herald,,,1

ZIFA appear to have closed the door on former Zimbabwe internationals Norman Mapeza and Bruce Grobbelaar and all prospective coaches they have recently interviewed for the Warriors job.

Instead, the Normalisation Committee running ZIFA on Tuesday brewed a shocker when they decided to re-advertise for the post.

Lincoln Mutasa’s Normalisation Committee have chosen to keep Zimbabweans guessing on a number of issues around the status of the nation’s flagship sport.

This includes an update on the reform process they are undertaking at ZIFA since their appointment by FIFA on July 11 last year, appointment of substantive national teams’ coaches, election roadmap and the venue of the Warriors’ next World Cup home assignment.

On Tuesday, Mutasa and his committee made an about turn on the interviews they had carried after the former Dynamos chairman claimed that they had received more than 100 applications for the Warriors job.

ZIFA had also literally auditioned Brazilian Baltemar Brito and Mapeza when they appointed them to take charge of the Warriors on an interim basis.

Mutasa and his crew also interviewed Warriors and Liverpool legend Grobbelaar on his visit to Harare in March.

Former Warriors defenders Kaitano Tembo and George Mbwando had also put their hands up for the Warriors job.

The Normalisation Committee who met last week reportedly hit a deadlock on the choice of Warriors coach amid indications that they were being pressured by some agents and cartels on who to appoint.

Despite receiving numerous applications for the Warriors job, ZIFA are still not satisfied and have started a fresh search just 30 days before Zimbabwe host Lesotho a World Cup, Group C qualifier on June 3.

The identity of the venue of that match against Lesotho has also not been made public.

ZIFA’s bid to lure Nyasa Big Bullets coach Kalisto Pasuwa from his job with the serial Malawi champions also hit a snag with the former Dynamos man electing to stay at his club.

Although ZIFA authorities have repeatedly chosen not to respond to media inquiries despite chief executive officer Yvonne Manwa acknowledging receipt of the questions, they let the cat out of the bag on their Warriors intentions, through the advert which they also placed through the FIFA website.

The move to restart the search for the Warriors coach also suggests that ZIFA have disbanded the technical committee, which included the likes of Moses Chunga and Gibson Homela, who they had set up to assist them in identifying the right personnel for the national teams’ posts.

According to the advert, “the candidates should hold higher qualifications like the CAF Pro Licence, CAF A Licence or any Pro-licence and have a minimum five years of international football experience at senior levels.

“The coach’s mandate will be to lead the senior men’s national team and direct the program and preparations for the team for various tournaments, including the 2025 AFCON qualifiers, the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and COSAFA tournaments.”

Mapeza was the last coach to work with the Warriors after he was once again appointed on interim basis to lead the side to a Four-Nations invitational tournament in Malawi in March.

Although there had been indications that Mapeza’s mandate would be extended to cover the World Cup qualifiers, ZIFA seem to have been influenced by reports of a public fallout between Italy-based midfielder Jordan Zemura’s camp and the FC Platinum coach.

It is not immediately clear how much time the new coach will have before he plans for the Warriors clash against Lesotho and South Africa, away a week later.

Ex-Highlanders coach Brito got the Warriors World Cup qualification bid underway when he took charge of the opening games against Rwanda and Nigeria in Huye which both ended in draws.

The Warriors first featured in a goalless draw with Rwanda, which was followed by a 1-1 stalemate against West African giants Nigeria.

The Normalisation Committee initially advertised for the vacant Warriors job in August last year, a month after their appointment by FIFA.

Among those that expressed interest then was Romanian–Hungarian coach Csaba Laszlo, who has vast experience coaching in both the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa leagues, Frank Nuttal of Scotland and Macedonian Gjoko Hadzievski.

The trio were among the over 15 foreign coaches to show interest in the job.

Lately Mbwando, a holder of UEFA A licence also submitted his application to ZIFA while Tembo, currently unattached since leaving South African Premiership side Sekhukhune United also expressed his interest.

The 53-year-old Tembo, a former Warriors vice-captain told a South-African-based online publication Far Post that he was available for the Warriors job should ZIFA consider him.

“I’ve gained a lot of experience, and for me, I’m a coach, and when you’re a coach, you don’t say I don’t want to coach. If the opportunity comes for me to coach the Warriors, I’m available. I’m a coach, and I can coach anywhere.

“I won’t say they haven’t approached me, but the most important thing to say is that I am available,’’ Tembo said.

Among other key attributes, ZIFA are looking for now is that the candidate must have “extensive international football knowledge and experience” at senior national team level and “prior experience coaching an African national team” as well as “familiarity with the role of sport science in preparing players for international competitions.”

The deadline for applications is this Sunday followed by interviews in the coming weeks.

Although there is a strong move within the Normalisation Committee to hire an expatriate, ZIFA’s history of a flawed recruitment of foreign coaches has been the major difference between Zimbabwe and their neighbours like South Africa and Zambia.

South Africa have enjoyed relative success with expatriates including incumbent and Nations Cup winner – Belgian Hugo Broos – while Zambia are on the rise again under ex-Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who boasts of huge experience with both European and African football.

Croat Zdravko “Loga’’ Logarusic, who had a disastrous spell with the senior team was the last substantive Warriors coach.

DESPITE leading Castle Lager Premier Soccer League newboys Bikita Minerals to a decent start to life in the top-flight, Saul Chaminuka may be on the verge of quitting the lithium miners.

Chaminuka has hinted that he is not a happy man at Bikita Minerals and has now been strongly linked with a cross over to Green Fuel, where the coaching job became vacant following the departure of Rodwell Dhlakama and his assistant Darlington Dodo.

Sources told Zimpapers Sports Hub that Chaminuka has also emerged among the front runners to replace Dhlakama at ambitious Green Fuel.

The sources indicated that a deal is expected to be thrashed out in time to allow Chaminuka to lead Green Fuel when they travel to Mandava for a date against former champions FC Platinum on Saturday.

Green Fuel chairman Fredson Moyo could not be reached for a comment, while Chaminuka declined to discuss the matter and referred all questions to the Chisumbanje outfit.

The experienced Chaminuka has lately won admiration for the brave manner in which he tried to save Black Rhinos from relegation.

Despite Bikita having a delayed start to the Premiership, Chaminuka has found a way to mould them into a competitive outfit.

Before settling for Bikita Minerals, Chaminuka who has also previously seen duty in Eswatini, received several offers at the beginning of this season, including a chance to return to relegated Triangle United, a team he coached more than 15 years ago in the ZIFA Eastern Region Division One.

He however, chose to remain in the Premiership where he has done well with Bikita Minerals winning three, secured as many draws and lost twice.

Bikita Minerals sit on eighth position on the 18-team log table with 12 points and six behind leaders Highlanders who have played a game more.

Although he was reluctant to discuss his immediate future, Chaminuka suggested he was being frustrated when he posted: “The most difficult thing is working for people who do not appreciate you but further sabotage your efforts,’’ on one of his social media platforms.",https://www.herald.co.zw/chaminuka-linked-to-green-fuel/,The Herald,Chaminuka linked to Green Fuel,,1

LADY Chevrons coach Walter Chawaguta was left heartbroken yesterday after his charges lost their final group game to the Netherlands and, for the second consecutive time, failed to qualify for the ICC T20 World Cup.

The Zimbabwe senior women’s cricket team failed to progress beyond the group stage of the qualifying tournament, unlike the last campaign two years ago when they fell at the last hurdle.

Chawaguta could not hide his disappointment after watching his charges fell to Netherlands by 14 runs in their final group match yesterday.

Having won one game out four group matches, the Lady Chevrons gaffer felt his charges performed below expectations.

“Obviously I’m very disappointed. We prepared well and thought we had all our resources put together nicely to do well and go on to the semi-finals and into the finals.

“Unfortunately, we played badly, fielded badly and our batting just wasn’t up to the point,” said Chawaguta.

The coach felt the team was caught wanting on all fronts at the World Cup qualifying tournament.

“We just didn’t handle certain scenarios with the bat or even more, so our catching was just poor.

“So, we gave the opposition more than we should have.

“They’re a whole lot of things that just didn’t come right. So, we have to go back home and go to the drawing board and see what we need to improve,” said Chawaguta.

After suffering a six-wicket defeat at the hands of Vanuatu, the Lady Chevrons re-ignited their hopes of qualifying with an eight-wicket victory against hosts UAE. But they blew up their qualifying chances with a 36-run defeat to Ireland earlier this week.

Zimbabwe went into yesterday’s match needing nothing short of victory against the Netherlands, but it was not to be as they suffered their fourth defeat of the tournament.

The defeat meant they were effectively eliminated from the tournament as they finished with only two points from the expected eight.

The Netherlands won the toss yesterday and elected to bat first. They posted a total of 135 runs for the loss of five wickets.  Zimbabwe, who have struggled with chasing, were again caught wanting after they were restricted to 121/4 in their allotted 20 overs.

FOR a boy, who was raised in the crime prone high-density suburb of Mbare, Clive Mandivei’s decision to become a ministry worker back in 2016, was a unique one.

He began a fresh journey as a ministry worker within the Prophetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries (PHD).

Apart from being an usher at Walter Magaya’s church, he would also assist in the Parish’s canteen.

During the same period Khama Billiat was making waves across Africa.

The former Warriors talisman was named the second-best footballer in Africa in January 2016, after helping Mamelodi Sundowns to win the CAF Champions League.

His teammate and goalkeeper Dennis Onyango won the top gong.

While Billiat was rocking on the continent, for both club and country, Mandivei was an unknown entity in local football circles.

But, a lot of things changed when Magaya decided to form Yadah Stars, who were subsequently promoted into the Premier Soccer League back in 2018.

The club gave a lot of unheralded players, including Mandivei, an opportunity to try their luck at football.

A lot also changed for Billiat, who shifted from Sundowns to Kaizer Chiefs where he spent a forgettable five seasons, before leaving the Soweto giants in June last year.

Billiat returned home in February and is now playing alongside Mandivei, who also captains Yadah.

Yadah are currently on a purple patch and they stretched their unbeaten run to four matches when they beat Chicken Inn 2-1 at Heart Stadium on Saturday, thanks to a brace from the penalty spot by Billiat.

With two wins and two draws in their last four outings, Yadah have picked up eight points out of a possible 12.

Billiat has now scored three goals in his last two matches, and Mandivei thinks the former Ajax Cape Town star, will bang “many goals this season.”

“Being a captain is one of the greatest honor an athlete can get, and captaining one of the best players in Africa is more than an honour,” says Mandivei.

“To be frank, I don’t have enough words to describe the feeling. It has been privilege to train with a player of Billiat’s calibre.

“It’s something that happens once in a blue moon.”

While most of the attention has been on Billiat since his grand arrival at Yadah in February, the forward has remained humble.

His teammates are also benefiting a lot from the gifted player.

“Sometimes he will not say anything but his actions speak volumes.

“You can see Billiat is someone who is hungry for success, he is always positive in both his words and actions, no matter the situation.

“He is humble and hardworking. He believes that for him to be the best version of himself or anyone to be the best, it starts with the team as iron sharpens iron.

“He is not after personal glory but he puts the team first.”

Mandivei will make his 74th league appearance for Yadah when The Miracles Boys host Simba Bhora at Rufaro on Saturday.

“If the truth be told, we are not a bad side.

“I believe we a very good squad which is capable of challenging for honours. We have been creating chances and that is important,” added Mandivei.

After failing to win in their opening five matches of, Yadah have turned the tables and are on a four-match unbeaten run.

“In a game of football you win, draw or lose.

“The league campaign is like a war with battles every week. If you lose a battle, it doesn’t mean you have lost the war,’’ Mandivei said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/as-fate-would-have-it-a-former-cook-now-captains-billiat/,The Herald,"As fate would have it, a former cook now captains Billiat",,1

THE African Union Sports Council (AUSC) Region Five Games are set to include martial arts in next year’s edition, scheduled for Windhoek, Namibia from May 2-11.

In line with the new development, AUSC have also extended an invitation to members of the Region 5 Karate Confederation including the Zimbabwe National Karate Federation to send a team to the annual games.

This comes just two months after ZNKF also sent karatekas to the 13th African Games in Accra, Ghana in March.

But in extending an invitation to ZNKF, AUSC, through their chief executive Stanley Mutoya, also listed seven conditions which the local body and other associations would have to adhere to.

“We are pleased to announce that karate has been included in the official programme of the 11th Edition of the Region 5 Youth Games scheduled for Windhoek, Namibia from 2 to 11 May 2025,” read part of the letter from Mutoya.  AUSC also gave the federation until Friday to ensure they comply with the conditions they have listed.

The conditions include that:

The ZNKF would have to appoint a technical delegate, an official, who will be assigned and responsible for the event next year
The official, however, cannot hold the position of a confederation president or secretary-general and the union will have to provide the said person’s name and contact details
ZNKF will also have to notify the AUSC of the style for the competition and make public the proposed team size they intend to send to the event
This list must include the number of athletes, coaches and referees’’.

ZNKF are also expected to send the information by tomorrow and also confirm in writing their acceptance of the offer.  Soon after, the union is then expected to start working on a technical manual, which is expected to be handed in by May 31.

ZNKF president, who is also the regional karate boss  Joe Rugwete was naturally excited by karate’s latest inclusion in a continental competition.

“The acceptance of our application to participate in the mainstream AUSC Region 5 Games is a momentous occasion for karate in Southern Africa,’’ Rugwete said.

“It signifies the recognition of our sport on a regional platform and provides an invaluable opportunity for our athletes to showcase their skills and talent to a wider audience.

“This inclusion not only elevates the status of karate in the region but also opens up doors for greater exposure and growth of the sport.

“For our youthful athletes, this opportunity holds immense promise and inspiration. Being able to compete in a prestigious event like the AUSC Region 5 Games will not only enhance their competitive experience but also serve as a platform for them to learn, grow, and interact with athletes from various disciplines.’’

Rugwete said local young karatekas stand to benefit the most from Zimbabwe’s participation at the Region 5 Games.

“This exposure can be pivotal in their development as athletes and can instill in them a sense of pride and motivation to excel in their karate pursuits.

“As we move forward with our preparations for these Games, we are committed to supporting and nurturing our young athletes, providing them with the necessary guidance, training, and resources to help them succeed on this regional stage.

“We are confident that their participation in this event will not only be a memorable experience for them but will also contribute to the overall development and promotion of karate in our region.

“We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to making a positive impact at the Games,’’ he said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/karate-for-ausc-region-5-games/,The Herald,Karate for AUSC Region 5 Games,,1

UNITED States-based Zimbabwean football star Francis Motsi is making waves in collegiate football with his IOWA Lakes Community College in Spencer.

Motsi, who plays as a left or right wide midfielder, recently won the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) award as well as the National Championship with his side after he managed to break into the school’s first team.

The former Prince Edward and Zengeza High 1 student, who previously played for Prince Edward Academy, Academy 2063, Power Eleven Academy and World Athletes Recruit, said he is looking forward to do well again this year.

“I am happy that I am making good progress after I joined the college in 2022. The level of competition is high and I am working hard to see my career grow.

“My intention is to play football professionally and at some point represent my country.

“I am on a scholarship with great mentorship and sponsorship by a great person, a father of two girls who I am not sure would love to have his name on the papers, but he is the reason I met the financial needs to chase my dreams.

“I am also grateful Archibald Tafadzwa Chisango, my elder brother, a great man who sacrificed all he had to make sure I am properly facilitated,” said Motsi.

Motsi grew up in Chitungwiza’s Zengeza 4 and attended Prince Edward School and Zengeza 1 High School before he left for State IOWA, in the United States of America in 2022 under a scholarship to fulfil his academic and footballing dream.

Motsi, who is also known by the nickname “Franco”, is fast emerging as one of his team’s key players for IOWA Lakes Community College.

The midfielder went to the United States to further his commercial degree studies after his first degree from National University of Science and Technology.

He played an important part in NUST’s third place finish in the 2021 Zimbabwe University’s Sports Association (ZUSA) Games which were held in Harare, scoring two important goals.

The attacking midfielder, who is inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo, also spoke of how he balances schoolwork and football, stating that to him it is natural and it has no formula.

“No formula really, it’s just about doing what you need for what you want. The two might be confused so it’s better to do them both so when you finally get to know what you want and what you really need, you will have two already and what will be left is to place them in the right position,” added Motsi.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zim-star-makes-waves-in-us/,The Herald,Zim Star makes waves in US,,1

DYNAMOS coach Genesis Mangombe says Sadney Urikhob is a magnificent striker who can step in and play a big part in answering some of the Harare giants’ goalscoring problems.

The big Namibian forward has come under the microscope after a slow start to life at the Glamour Boys which pales the hype he received upon joining the team early this year.

With DeMbare struggling to pick solid form especially in front of goal, pressure has been mounting, for Urikhob to deliver especially.

That his partners in attack, Alexander Mandinyenya and Emmanuel Paga are already off the mark with three goals between themselves has only served to add more pressure on Urikhob.

Dynamos have scored just seven goals in eight games with Paga, who has netted twice the team’s leading scorer.

Urikhob’s shortcomings have been made largely evident by the value brought by fellow newcomer Frederick Ansah-Botchway of Ghana, whose industry in midfield has already won him so many admirers.

But Mangombe, who himself has shaken off the pressure that had followed his team’s indifferent start, has come out in full support of his striker.

“Sadney Urikhob is an impressive prospect with extraordinary qualities.

“He just needs to get that opening goal and start going,” said Mangombe.

“You look at the amount of energy that he throws in, his off the ball runs and ability to be a team player.

“I think we just need to be a bit patient with him. He is coming into a new league at a team with so much expectations but he is making huge strides in terms of adaptation.

“I believe in his capabilities and if I look at him closely, I have no doubt that he will play a major role in helping the team achieve its goals.

“He is a great team player who is not only limited to scoring goals but can also string good passes in the attacking third while also playing huge roles defensively.

“I am confident that with what he has shown me, Urikhob can be a great deal in our ambitions this season.”

A number of Dynamos players haven’t yet arrived on the scene this term but it is Urikhob, who has received the larger part of the brickbats being thrown by doubters.

The forward will this Saturday get another opportunity to win over the DeMbare fans when his side face Chicken Inn in a league game at Barbourfields.

Urikhob and Dynamos will be looking to pocket the maximum points and improve their position on the log.

They currently sit in mid-table with eight points wedging them from pacesetters Highlanders, notwithstanding the possibility of them being awarded three points from their aborted match against Chegutu Pirates a fortnight ago.

They were leading 1-0 in that encounter when rogue elements decided to force a stop to the encounter but Dynamos know they cannot count on something, which is not in their control.

DeMbare will need to be at their best to get something against Chicken Inn who have had a promising start under returning coach Joey Antipas.  One of their most consistent performers and vice-captain Emmanuel Jalai is out of the tie as he will be serving suspension for picking three yellow cards.

They will also be without skipper Frank Makarati who has been grounded by a knee sprain.

“We will certainly miss captain Frank Makarati and his vice Emmanuel Jalai. They really play key roles with their leadership qualities inside the field of play,’’ said Mangombe.

“However, we have good players who will fit in and try to help the club while showing us what they can give.

“At the end of the day, we need to win the game against Chicken Inn. Chicken Inn is a very good team and we really need to arrive at the party,’’ added Mangombe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/mangombe-backs-his-namibian-man/,The Herald,Mangombe backs his Namibian man,,1

REIGNING National Association of School Heads (NASH) chess champion Matifadzaishe Mhungu is racing against time to get her lifetime opportunity of taking part in the Africa Youth Chess Championship (AYCC) scheduled for Ekurhuleni in Gauteng, South Africa, from June 15 to 23.

The 17-year-old Howard High School student won the ticket to represent the country when she won at the Cook More sponsored chess championship at Chipindura in Bindura early last month.

It will be the third time that Mhungu will be missing out on such an opportunity despite her talent in the sport.

“My first medal came in 2019 when I won the Under-12 categories before I won the 2022 NASH Under-15.

“The win in 2022 was supposed to see me travel to Namibia in 2022 but again because of financial challenges I failed. It was last year again that I won the Under-16 category at Cheziya and I was supposed to make the trip to Cairo, Egypt, but again I could not afford it.

“This year I am supposed to be taking part in the tournament in South Africa which has a ticket to qualify for the World Youth Championship set for Brazil later this year.

“I feel pain that my parents cannot afford to help me get a basic such as a passport as we come from a poor background and my talent is not getting to its full potential,” said Mhungu.

The athlete is hopeful that some corporates will come on board as she is racing against time to register with the Zimbabwe Chess Federation whose deadline for confirmation is May 5.

Mhungu’s mother, Easter, said they are not giving up hope as there are some organisations who have pledged to support them.

“I think the dates for the deadline are a challenge. We received the letter on April 24 and the registration will only close on May 5. We do not have much time since she does not have a passport and the trip is self-sponsored which will be difficult for us.

“My daughter is going as an additional player and she will foot all her travel and accommodation fares.

154,Sports,"Madrid. — TWENTY-TWO time Grand Slam champion Rafa Nadal fell 7-5 6-4 to Czech Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Madrid Open on Tuesday, marking his final appearance at a tournament he has won five times.

In just over two hours, a feisty Lehecka thwarted Nadal’s hopes of reaching his 100th Masters 1000 quarter-final after a fairytale run in only his second tournament since January as the Spaniard struggled with injury.  Nadal has said he expects to retire after the 2024 season.

“I’m happy. It was a very special week for me, very positive in every way.

“I was able to play again on a court that has given me a lot, also on an emotional level,” the 37-year-old Nadal said in an on-court interview in front of an emotional crowd.

“It has been unforgettable, and I can only say ‘thank you’. It has been an incredible journey. It’s very difficult, but life and my body have been sending signals to me for a long time.

“I have been fortunate to turn my passion into my job. I am privileged,” he said before organisers honoured him with a trophy and unfurled banners paying tribute to his five Madrid titles.

With the score level at 5-5 in the first set, 30th seed Lehecka broke serve and then held his own to take the lead.

Breaking again in the first game of the second set, the 22-year-old secured the win to reach the quarter-finals.

“It’s amazing. For me to share the court with such a legendary player is a dream come true. I always wished to have this happen. I’m very grateful to achieve such a big moment,” Lehecka said.

“All the best to Rafa. It’s kind of bittersweet to have such a nice win in front of all these people cheering for him. The energy was amazing, it was like I was in another universe. This was something I’ve never experienced before in my life on a tennis court.” — Reuters.",https://www.herald.co.zw/nadal-bids-farewell-to-madrid-after-defeat-by-lehecka/,The Herald,Nadal bids farewell to Madrid after defeat by Lehecka,,1
155,Sports,"London. — Harry Kane has revealed Jude Bellingham said “you are going to go left of the keeper” as the Real Madrid midfielder tried to put off his England team-mate before the Bayern Munich forward took his penalty in the Champions League semi-final.

Bellingham could be seen mumbling something to Kane as the Bayern striker stepped up to take the spot-kick in the 57th minute of the first leg.

However, the England captain placed his penalty to the right of goalkeeper Andriy Lunin to give Bayern a 2-1 lead at Allianz Arena – although Vinicius Junior later also converted from the spot as the match ended all square.

Kane said he did not hear what Bellingham said on the pitch but that the 20-year-old told him after the match.

“In the moment, I didn’t know what he said but I spoke to him after and he said: ‘I know you are going to go left of the keeper’.

“On the pitch, I knew he was there but I didn’t know what he said. But I went left anyway.

“It was nice for me because I saw the keeper go a little bit early and I put it away.”

It was Kane’s 43rd goal in 43 games in all competitions this season and helps Bayern in their aim of finishing the season on a high, with the Champions League the only trophy they remain in contention for.

Kane left Tottenham last summer for an initial £86m in the hope of winning trophies with 11-time Bundesliga champions Bayern.  But Bayer Leverkusen have already halted that run while Thomas Tuchel’s side were knocked out of the German Cup in the second round by third-tier side Saarbrucken.

The 54-hole tournament, the 13th event of the LIV Golf campaign, will be played at 7 104-yards Bolingbrook Golf Club.

In addition to deciding the final placings for the individual crown, the event will determine seedings for the LIV Team Championship.

“It will be an incredible setting for a high-stakes event as players battle it out for the individual title and a roster spot for 2025,” said LIV Golf commissioner Greg Norman.

Players who finish in the top 24 of the season standings will secure spots for the 2025 season while those with expiring contracts in the 25-48 positions will become free agents.

Those lower would be relegated out and forced into a promotion tournament to regain a LIV Golf berth in 2025.

There is already uncertainty around LIV Golf’s 2025 campaign with its Saudi financiers, the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), in merger talks with the PGA Tour, negotiations that have stretched well beyond a deadline at the end of 2023.

Thus far, the upstart circuit that lured away several top PGA Tour players has awaited news following last June’s framework agreement merger plan between the PGA Tour and PIF, one that shocked PGA Tour players after months of feuding between the rival tours.

Chile’s Joaquin Niemann, with wins in Mexico and Jeddah this season, leads the LIV points race with world number five Jon Rahm of Spain, last year’s Masters champion, second and South African Dean Burmester third.  American Talor Gooch won last year’s LIV Golf season title.

LIV Golf’s seventh event of the season will be next weekend at Singapore.

157,Sports,"London. — Bayer Leverkusen are gunning for revenge today when they travel to a second Europa League semifinal against Roma in as many years after yet another late escape kept their remarkable unbeaten run intact.

Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen staff were filmed celebrating Roma’s passage past AC Milan in the last eight, and today’s first leg at the Stadio Olimpico is a chance to purge the memory of being ‘Mourinhoed’ in last season’s last four.

Already a formidable proposition last term, Leverkusen’s astonishing run of 46 matches without defeat and a first-ever Bundesliga title has them favourites to reach the final in Dublin.

And the team which broke Bayern Munich’s dominance of German football wants payback for the 1-0 aggregate loss which led to Roma’s agonising penalty shoot-out defeat to Sevilla in last season’s final.

“We have a desire for revenge, and a great hunger to win and get ourselves into the final,” said Leverkusen CEO Fernando Corro to Radio Marca.

“We want to get to the final at all costs.”

Leverkusen have scored 16 goals in stoppage time this season in all competitions, the latest coming in the 96th minute of last weekend’s 2-2 draw with Stuttgart.

And it’s been their habit for late strikes which has got them back to the Europa League semis, with former Roma man Patrik Schick scoring three times in added time over their 5-4 last-16 win against Qarabag and two more late goals helping them past West Ham in the quarterfinals.

Coach Alonso said his team’s ability to claw back results at the death was “hard to explain” after Robert Andrich snatched a point at Stuttgart but is hoping it holds out for the rest of the campaign.

“Our main objective was to become champions, but now we don’t want to stop,” added Alonso to Sky.

With chances of qualifying for the 2024 ICC Women T20 World Cup no longer in their hands, Zimbabwe senior women’s cricket team coach Walter Chawaguta is hoping for a miracle to see his charges progress to the semi-finals.

The Lady Chevrons will play Netherlands today in a must-win match to keep their slim chances alive. A defeat would mean that they will miss qualification for the global event for the second consecutive time.

However, Chawaguta has chosen to remain hopeful although admitting that the team made the situation difficult for themselves after losing two games and winning one.

“It is always good to have hope.

“We have made things difficult for ourselves,” said Chawaguta.

Having lost to Vanuatu and Ireland and winning against hosts UAE, Chawaguta feels the tournament has not gone according to their plan.

“We have had some meetings and discussed what needed to be done. One of the things we spoke about is that we have to start well, whether it is with the bat or the ball, but this is not what has happened.

“We have not been good with either the bat or the ball in matches we have lost,” said Chawaguta.

Zimbabwe sits in fourth position in the five-team group. They have two points and an inferior run-rate to Netherlands and UAE, who have the same number of points.

With a scheduled match against Netherlands today, Chawaguta is hoping his charges will get a win and keep their slim chances alive.

“It now depends on other results but first and foremost we have to win our game against the Netherlands. There are quite a few ways this can go (progressing to the semi-finals) and we hope that things go our way.

“And like I said, first and foremost we have to beat the Netherlands as it is the only thing that will keep us in the hunt,” said Chawaguta.

Zimbabwe women’s bowler Loreen Tshuma revealed that the team will concentrate on their match against Netherlands.

“We just need to concentrate on what is controllable and what is controllable is that we play well tomorrow (today) and win our game. We will see what happens from there because there are still other teams that are yet to play. So, the main thing is to win the game,” said Tshuma.

Tshuma, one of the senior players in the Zimbabwe dressing room, has urged her teammates to keep trusting the process and stick to their plans ahead of the last group match.

“I think we need to go through our processes; we have a plan for the game, and I think if we stick to the plan and go through the process everything will come out right,” said Tshuma.

She reckoned that the match against Netherlands will not be an easy task.

“Netherlands are a good side, they play good cricket, and we have to be at our best,” she said.

Tshuma revealed the team was high in confidence despite suffering a defeat on Monday to Ireland which dented their chances of progressing to the last four.

“After the defeat, the morale was down but we came together as a team, and we agreed that we should not allow the result to affect us.

“Because we still have a game to go, we discussed the little things we need to do right and everyone is in the right space for today’s game,” she said.

The top two teams from each of the two groups will progress to semi-finals and the finalists automatically qualify for the ICC T20 World to be hosted by Bangladesh in   October.",https://www.herald.co.zw/lady-chevrons-pray-for-miracle/,The Herald,Lady Chevrons pray for miracle,,1

Plumtree . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5) 15

Mutare Boys High . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5) 5

MUTARE Boys High and Plumtree were yesterday the focal point of the Mwana Group International Schools Rugby festival and the two senior sides did not disappoint as they put on quite a spectacle, albeit in a low-scoring encounter at Prince Edward’s Jubilee field yesterday.

Their respective coaches, Casper Belt Bandi, and Francis Nakamu, were united in their gratitude for the return of the festival and felt their charges could have done better to make full use of the opportunity afforded to them.

For Nakamu, he was left to rue the absence of many of his regular starters and felt his Plumtree unit could have then won by a bigger margin.

“We will take the win, but I was not happy with my boys’ performance,” said Nakamu.

“We play very good rugby but today the guys seemed to be absent and we only got the win through some individual brilliance from one or two players. “We were supposed to have won by a bigger margin but, maybe, I am going to point that to the absence of some of my starters.

“The kids from Plumtree come from all over the country and some of the parents refused to release their children. The only good thing to come out of that was that it allowed some fringe players to showcase their talents.

“Now, we have a bigger base,” he said.

Maybe it was the perfectionist in Nakamu but Plumtree did have their bright moments and in a dominant show. Winger Lawrence Ndlovu was arguably one of the best players on the park and capped off his Player-of-the-Match performance with a brace of tries, either side of half-time, while Iblamu Dumbura put the icing on the cake when planting Plumtree’s third. Mutare found the going tough with Djimburu Manyuchi scoring his side’s only try in the first half.

However, the team seem to be a work in progress as Bandi tried to look on the bright side and chalk off the result as “a learning curve’’.

“Plumtree came out with the right mentality and deservedly won,” he said.

“It was a bad day in the office for us and now we go back to the drawing board to prepare for our next game against Milton.

BULAWAYO Chiefs hitman, Never Rauzhi, is the go-to man when one needs a solid relationship with a broth-er-in-law.

Stallon Dinala, who is married to Rauzhi’s sister, inspired the Ninjas’ front man to become a professional footballer.

Rauzhi recorded the solitary goal, which floored Chegutu Pirates in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League tie at Luveve on Sunday to take his tally to five goals this season.

The 23-year-old is now jointly leading the Golden Boot race with Lynoth Chikuhwa of Highlanders.

Strangely, Rauzhi is giving all the flowers to his brother-in-law for going out of his way to make him believe in what seemed a distant dream.

Dinala is a former footballer who once played for Harare  City’s developmental side in the ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League.

He realised Rauzhi’s potential when he was just 16 and took him to a Division Two side, which is based in Kuwadzana, named Dutch.

That is when Rauzhi realised there was no turning back and he saw the need to make his brother-in-law proud.

“I want to thank my family and friends who have supported my vision from the beginning.

“But I want to thank my brother-in-law for playing a huge role in helping me to become a professional footballer.

“He is the one who took me to Dutch when I was just 16 and playing in Division Two at that age gave me every reason to trust the process,’’ said Rauzhi.

Rauzhi had endured two below-par campaigns before this season.

He made his Premiership breakthrough at Tenax three seasons ago before joining Triangle last year.

His goals were not enough to afford the Chiredzi side any chance to be part of the top-flight league proceedings this campaign.

But, they gave his coach, Thulani Sibanda, all the reasons to bring him on board when he returned to Bulawayo Chiefs.

Rauzhi also told Zimpapers Sports that he is surprised with how the tables have turned for the better in his career this campaign.

“I had offers from other clubs but I chose this team because of the trust which coach, Sibanda had shown me during our time at Triangle.

“I’m surprised with how things have turned out because if you ask me, I wasn’t expecting to be moving with this speed but God has made it possible.

“I have challenged myself to take responsibility for every result of our fixtures and maybe that’s why I’m having this pressure of wanting to score as many times as possible because the ultimate goal is to play for the Warriors,” he said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/rauzhi-owes-it-all-to-brother-in-law/,The Herald,Rauzhi owes it all to brother-in-law,,1
161,Entertainment,"Switzerland and the Netherlands, two of the favorite's to win  , secured spots in Saturday’s grand final alongside   despite   and booing during its performance. Some 100,000 visitors have gathered in the southern Swedish city of Malmo for the annual kitsch-fest, under heavy police presence as authorities brace for possible unrest. Swiss rapper and singer Nemo, 24, qualified from the second semi-final on Thursday with the song ‘The Code,’ as did Joost Klein, 26, of the Netherlands with his song ‘Europapa.’ “Singing this song in front of a live audience and knowing that so many people are listening made me really emotional,” Nemo said during a news conference following the semi-final. The song, a drum-and-bass, opera, rap, and rock tune, is about Nemo’s journey of self-discovery as a non-binary person. “I think it’s really important that we have so much queer representation this year,” Nemo said, referring to Irish contestants Bambie Thug, who also secured a spot in the final after performing in the first semi-final on Tuesday. Israeli solo artist Eden Golan, 20, and her song ‘Hurricane’ also qualified for Saturday’s grand show, which will feature performances from 26 countries. Some booing was heard from the crowd before, during and after Golan’s performance but also applause and Israeli flags waving, according to a Reuters journalist in the auditorium. “I’m so overwhelmed with emotions,” Golan later told the news conference. “It’s truly such an honor to be here on stage performing and showing our voice and representing us with pride,” she said, adding the organizers had taken precautions to make the event safe for everyone. The solo artist characterizes her song as a strong power ballad that describes a person going through a storm of emotions. Armenia, Austria, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Latvia and Norway also qualified for the final. Eurovision organizers had resisted calls to exclude Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, arguing that the competition is a non-political event. More than 10,000 pro-Palestinian campaigners, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, staged a non-violent protest in the hours ahead of the semi-final, waiving Palestinian flags and shouting “boycott Israel”. A smaller group of pro-Israeli supporters, including members of Malmo’s Jewish community, also staged a peaceful demonstration in the city, defending Golan and her nation’s right to take part in the contest. Hundreds of artists in Sweden and elsewhere have pushed for Israel to be blocked from taking part, as did two Belgian government ministers earlier this year. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the event, requested earlier this year that Israel tweak its initial lyrics in order to participate, saying they had originally made reference to the Oct. 7 attack. In a video statement earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation. “You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism — and representing the State of Israel with enormous honor,” Netanyahu said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-secures-spot-eurovision-grand-final-protests-rcna151613,NBC,Israel secures spot in Eurovision grand final despite protests,,2

The event was not permitted or sanctioned by the city. Cenat, a video game streamer, made promises that he’d give away video game consoles, PCs, gaming chairs and keyboards, among other highly sought-after items. Hundreds attended. Police said bottles, rocks and fireworks were thrown, aerial video showed people standing on cars, and the NYPD said three officers were injured after police were attacked and in the crush of people. “The total restitution of $57,099 covers the landscaping damage and additional staff hours needed for clean-up,” the Manhattan DA’s office said. “All of the restitution payments have already been made.” Cenat, now 22, himself paid $55,000 to the Union Square Partnership under the deal, the district attorney’s office said. He posted an apology on social media Tuesday in which he admitted he created “an unintentional dangerous situation due to the way I promoted and advertised it.” “I am from NY and would never want to see the city turned upside down due to unwanted, irresponsible, and dangerous behavior,” Cenat wrote. “I wanted to do something cool and fun for people and did not think it was going to turn into something that caused harm to the city, and I should have thought more about the post before I announced it,” he wrote. The NYPD arrested Cenat on charges of riot, inciting to riot and unlawful assembly.

The legislation is the latest to combat unfair ticketing practices, an issue that has   since the sale of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour tickets in 2022. A Minnesota bill named after Swift was  , requiring ticket price transparency and prohibiting resellers from offering the same ticket more than once.  The bill was first introduced in January by state Sens. Dawn Gile, Brian Feldman, Pamela Beidle and Arthur Ellis.  In a phone interview, Gile said that the bill will create a ""fairer landscape"" for consumers and prevent them from getting ""tricked into paying more than what they should be paying."" ""There was a lot of attention on this bill, and I think it's because people are just so outraged by how expensive tickets are,"" Gile said. Resellers will be prohibited from selling speculative tickets, which are tickets that are not currently in the seller’s possession.  Resellers will also be required to disclose the total price of a ticket, including taxes and fees. They must also issue refunds to ticket purchasers if a ticket turns out to be counterfeit, if the event is canceled or if the ticket does not match what was advertised. The law goes into effect on July 1. Maryland will become the first state to fine resellers and platforms that offer speculative tickets. Moore said in a statement that the law will “help lower costs” for Maryland residents hoping to enjoy live events in the state’s venues. “Resale markets have put rapidly rising costs on consumers and this will help our state protect people from unnecessary price hikes,” Moore said.  Similar legislation has been proposed on a federal level but has yet to move past committee.  The Fans First Act, introduced in December by a bipartisan group of senators, also seeks to ban the sale of speculative tickets and prohibit other deceptive ticketing practices.  Last month,  , including Billie Eilish, Green Day and Chappell Roan, signed a letter in support of the legislation.  “We are joining together to say that the current system is broken: predatory resellers and secondary platforms engage in deceptive ticketing practices to inflate ticket prices and deprive fans of the chance to see their favorite artists at a fair price,"" the letter read.

On May 1, TikTok user Mississippi Memaw (@mississippimemaw) shared a   of her ordering a pickle-filled Dr Pepper at the drive-through of her local Sonic. The video generated 3.8 million views and brought attention to a regional beverage remix that’s been bubbling under the radar. “Do y’all like pickles? Do y’all like Dr Pepper? Well come on with Memaw, cause Memaw’s fitting to show you something,” the TikToker states in her video.  After patiently waiting in the drive-through, a restaurant worker takes Memaw’s order of a large Dr Pepper with pickles. Missing from the exchange is what some might expect to be confusion, although the worker does say she has to charge the customization by marking it down as cherries. The TikToker breezily gets her drink order, paying $3.62 for the concoction.  “Alright I done put my straw in my cup, but let’s see what it looks like,” Memaw says, showing off the floating dill pickle slices in her soda pop. “Don’t knock it till you try it. If you like pickles and you like Dr Pepper, and you’re probably like ‘Ew gross, I would never ever drink that,’ but there’s a lot of people that do drink this,” Memaw says, stirring the pickles further into her drink. “Did you hear her, the way she took my order? I’m not the only person that’s ever ordered this, babe.” Finishing the video by enjoying a long sip of the drink, Memaw encourages her viewers to try it for themselves. “It’s really good. Y’all should try it.” Memaw’s short and sweet video seems to have struck a nerve, with nearly 6,500 comments talking about the flavor combination. “me and 2 year old tried it today!! new favorite,” wrote one commenter. “I got to try this at home bc the way my sonic would call the police on me 😬😮‍💨,” wrote another. “I’ve been drinking dr pepper with pickles since the late 80s,” someone already aware of the beverage chimed in. “But it has to be Best Maid dill!!” Referring to the Sonic employee, someone wrote, “I love how she isn’t even phased 🤣👏,” to which Memaw replied, “Nope 🤣.” Some people who say they are current and former Sonic employees shared their experiences as well. “This was the strangest order I ever remember getting when I worked at Sonic in high school. 🤣,” wrote one user. “I have worked for Sonic for over 20+ years and I have never gotten a customer that has ordered a pickle Dr Pepper,” wrote another, with someone else adding, “it’s probably a regional thing that’s common to order.” Since Memaw’s video went viral, it   are  . Some are   and   on the platform, garnering thousands of views themselves. There are so many people interested in the briny beverage that a Sonic worker — who spoke to TODAY.com and asked to be referred to as Macy —   to express confusion at the sudden uptick. “I’ve had three people order pickles in their Dr Pepper today what is happening,” reads an on-screen caption on the video, which had 1.1 million views at the time of reporting. Sonic confirmed to TODAY.com it has noticed more orders of what it’s calling a “Dr. Pepper Pucker.” “With thousands of unique ways to customize your drink at SONIC, we are no stranger to seeing our fans create fun and unexpected flavor combinations,” a Sonic representative tells TODAY.com.  “The addition of pickle slices was a new one though, and we’ve seen an increase in guests adding them to their drinks over the past week,” the rep continues. “While the ‘Dr. Pepper Pucker’ is not an official drink on SONIC’s menu, we appreciate and encourage the creativity.

166,Entertainment,"A woman who claims to be the inspiration for the stalker character of Martha in “Baby Reindeer” said the popular Netflix show was “defamatory” and called much of the plot a “work of fiction.” Comedian Richard Gadd created and starred in the series, which follows his character, Donny, as he navigates being stalked by an older woman named Martha (played by Jessica Gunning). Though Gadd said the story is based on his true personal experiences, he has   that the character Martha is not meant to resemble her real-life counterpart. But after the show’s popularity boomed, many online began speculating around the real Martha’s identity. The theorizing got so intense that, by late April, Gadd had posted an Instagram story   with their unsubstantiated guesswork. In the  , uploaded to his YouTube page Thursday, Fiona Harvey, 58, said she was “forced” to come forward about her experience after internet sleuths began harassing her online.   The show has “taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online, people phoning me up,” Harvey said. “It’s been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn’t give credence to something like that, and it’s not really my kind of drama.” Harvey said neither Netflix nor Gadd contacted her about the show, which she also said she has not watched. She said she “absolutely” plans to take legal action against Gadd and Netflix. A spokesperson for Gadd and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.  Gadd’s Netflix series was adapted from his one-man show, which  . It’s described on Gadd’s website as a “chilling personal narrative exploring obsession, delusion, and the aftermath of a chance encounter.” Gadd previously   that the show went to “such great lengths to disguise [his stalker] to the point that I don’t think she would recognize herself.”  Watching the show, viewers are met with a message that flashes on screen that reads, “This is a true story.” Later, when the credits roll, the text reads: “This program is based on real events: however certain characters, names, incidents, locations, and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.” In her interview, Harvey disputed several of the incidents and details depicted on the show. She said she met Gadd when she visited a London pub for a meal. Unlike in the show, she said, Gadd never offered her a cup of tea. She said she never caught Gadd looking through her window, heckled his comedy show or attacked his girlfriend. Harvey also said that she did not know where he lived and that she never visited his house, nor did she contact his parents. “That’s completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me. Very career damaging, and I wanted to report that completely on this show. I’m not a stalker. I’ve not been to jail,” Harvey said. “This is just complete nonsense.” Morgan grilled Harvey about the emails, voice messages, tweets, Facebook messages and letters Martha sent Donny on the show. Harvey said she sent Gadd a handful of emails, tweeted him about 18 times and wrote him one letter. She said she never texted him or messaged him on Facebook. Asked about the show’s title — a moniker that Martha gave Donny — Harvey said she did own a baby reindeer toy as a child. She said her joke mentioning it to Gadd inadvertently gave the show its name. Harvey could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Morgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The saga comes amid increased attention surrounding the show and fans’ impulse to “ .” Experts have told NBC News that the desire to sleuth, which has become commonplace on the internet, is a symptom of the internet’s   and its  . Aside from trying to identify real-life Martha, viewers were also trying to pin down Gadd’s real-life inspiration for the character Darrien, a TV comedy writer who sexually assaults Donny. Many online soon began to accuse British actor, writer and director Sean Foley of being real-life Darrien, without real evidence. Foley   that he had called upon the police to investigate viewers’ “defamatory abusive and threatening” posts against him. For Harvey, Gadd’s Instagram statement did little to quell the harassment. “Saying ‘don’t speculate,’ wow, that’s a bit rich now, isn’t it? Fans do speculate,” Harvey told Morgan. “Wednesday, The Daily Mail got in touch with me, so that was all over BBC breaking news Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.” During a panel discussion Tuesday at a screening in Los Angeles, Gadd   that he never viewed his stalker as a villain, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  “I think I struggle with a toxic empathy problem,” Gadd said. “I remember when I was getting stalked, it was relentless and felt like it was everywhere, and I felt like my life wasn’t really functioning. I still had these unbelievable pangs of feeling sorry for her.” Harvey told Morgan that she was not under the impression that Gadd ever felt sorry for her. “I think he’s psychotic, and I think that anyone going along, being in that play and doing this to somebody, I find the behavior outrageous,” she said, later adding that she “should never have gone in that bar.” Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/baby-reindeer-alleged-martha-speaks-out-piers-morgan-rcna151585,NBC,Woman who allegedly inspired stalker character in 'Baby Reindeer' says show was 'defamatory',,2
167,Entertainment,"Taylor Swift fans from North America are going the extra mile — literally. The pop star   the 18-city European leg of her “Eras Tour” on Thursday in Paris, where she was joined in the París La Défense Arena by thousands of American Swifties who flew overseas to see her. Thursday’s concert introduced a new setlist that reordered certain eras — including by moving “Red” up to earlier in the night — and combining the “Evermore” and “Folklore” eras, according to social media users who posted from the concert. She  . More than a quarter of tickets for the four Paris shows this weekend were purchased by Americans, according to Frédéric Longuépée, CEO of the París La Défense Arena. Tickets for the venue’s shows all sold in under an hour, he added. “To the best of my understanding, a lot of Americans chose to come to Paris to attend this show and obviously visit our beautiful city,” said Longuépée, who estimated “something like 25–30%” of the crowd would be Americans, “which is big.” Kennedy Smith, 21, skipped her college graduation to fly with her mother, Kathleen Smith, 56, from Texas to Paris to attend Swift’s concert instead. Kathleen Smith said getting to see the singer was “nothing short of a miracle” — the pair stayed up all night in hopes of securing tickets, which cost them around $1,500 each. The two were first in line Wednesday to purchase merchandise at the venue, walking away with two bags full of Swift-themed gear. Her daughter called the experience the “trip of a lifetime.” “This is my graduation-from-college gift at Texas A&M,” she said. “And I’ve always wanted to come to Europe. ... And then to be seeing Taylor Swift, it’s just a dream come true.” Securing tickets for the North American “Eras Tour” initially   that the Senate Judiciary Committee   criticizing Ticketmaster’s “monopoly” after the platform   in November 2022 amid overwhelming demand. Some fans had reported that their invite codes failed to work, while others said they abruptly lost the tickets they had already placed in their cart. The chaos, which garnered a response  , led Ticketmaster to offer some scorned fans   at buying tickets. The saga continued last year when Ticketmaster   for the “Eras Tour” shows in Paris and Lyon, after the website crashed amid technical glitches and hourslong wait times plaguing the more than 700,000 fans in the queue. Zoe McCormack, a Canadian fan who  , said she managed to get tickets the following week for multiple nights in Paris, where she now lives. She said her non-VIP tickets here cost €190 each, or about $205, making them more affordable than U.S. tickets. Many tickets for Swift’s shows in Europe cost only a fraction of what tickets cost for her U.S. dates, making them more financially accessible for North American fans who either failed to secure tickets in the U.S. last year or found prices too exorbitant. Some resale tickets sold for tens of thousands of dollars. “I’m so happy that she came to Paris, especially since she has that ‘Paris’ song. I’ve been waiting for this moment ever since I moved to Paris,” McCormack said. “I’m so excited to be here. I can’t believe that it’s already here because we got the tickets almost a year ago. So it’s been a whole year of anticipation, getting the costumes ready, getting our bracelets ready.” Traveling to see concerts abroad is not a new phenomenon, as buying tickets for concerts in the U.S. has become an increasingly competitive and highly expensive ordeal for fans of popular artists such as Swift,   and  .

168,Entertainment,"It’s easier to change an   lyric than it is to change a tattoo of it — and that’s exactly what the singer vowed to do for fan Grace Flemming. Flemming, 20, first heard Rodrigo’s song “Hope Ur OK” in 2021, when the three-time Grammy-winning singer released it on her album “Sour.” She immediately “knew” she wanted a tattoo of one of the lyrics, “address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings,” the Colorado resident tells TODAY.com. She finally got the ink last month on her waist, only to later discover that it incorrectly read “butterwings” instead of “butterfly wings.” Flemming  , encouraging people to double check spellings before getting tattoos. Flemming is emotional in the video that now has more than a million views. In the caption, she asks Rodrigo to change the lyric so her tattoo is correct. “I’m literally crying over my nails right now,” she says in the viral video. The “Vampire” singer left a comment May 6 saying Flemming’s tattoo was the new lyric. “HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH OMG THIS IS THE NEW LYRIC IM CHANGING IT TO BUTTERWINGS,” Rodrigo wrote. Flemming says she can’t believe Rodrigo saw the video, let alone responded. Now, she doesn’t know if she’ll take up the tattoo artist’s offer to fix the tattoo so it matches the original lyric. “Not changing it definitely makes it more unique and special. I kind of want to keep it, but also want to get the right lyrics. Maybe I’ll keep this one, and get the   lyrics somewhere else,” she says. The lyric is her favorite of Rodrigo’s, Flemming says. She has long admired how caterpillars turn into butterflies. “Everybody already has their own wounds or holes. So I take the (line), ‘Address the letters to the holes of my butterfly wings,’ (to say) if somebody’s gonna say something mean, they can say it to me. But, it’s just gonna go through me. It’s gonna go through that hole,” she says. She toyed around with actually getting the tattoo for three years. Once her mind was made up, though, it only took her a week to plan the design. Flemming asked her tattoo artist to stitch together words Rodrigo had previously written in letters and emails sent to fans so the tattoo would appear to be in the singer’s handwriting. “I have loved Olivia since 2015. It was so exciting to have a piece of my favorite artist on me,” she says. Flemming admits she didn’t fully read the text when the tattoo artist showed her the stencil. “I’m such a person who’s like, ‘I want to see the finished product. Just do it. It looks great. I can’t wait,’” she says. She left the parlor joyful and unaware of the error. Then, she then sent a picture to her boyfriend, who immediately noticed the typo. “The little bubbles were typing for so long. And I was like, ‘What is he going to say? Does he think it looks bad? What is it?’” she says. He finally responded, “Did you take out the ‘fly’?” Flemming says she “just stared at his text,” thinking, “There is no way.” She went to sleep and woke up the next day assuming it was just a dream, she says. But it wasn’t a dream. In the month since getting the tattoo, Flemming says she has encountered an array of reactions. People have called her “stupid” for not actually reading the stencil. She shrugs those comments off, saying most people she encounters don’t even notice the mistake until she points it out. Her mom, who does not like any of her five tattoos, has used the mix-up to bolster her case of why she “shouldn’t get tattoos.” She’s learned to embrace the error. “Sometimes I get a little angry about it. But it’s so funny. I tell random strangers who are like, ‘I like your tattoo,’ and I’m like, ‘Oh, well let me show you,” she says. “It’s kind of become such a big thing where I’m kind of like, ‘Oh, this is a really good mistake.’”",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/olivia-rodrigo-responds-fan-got-lyric-tattooed-major-typo-rcna151325,NBC,Olivia Rodrigo responds to fan who got a lyric tattooed with a major typo,,2

172,Business,"TheSocial Security Administrationis set to implement new rules to make it easier for beneficiaries to access certain benefits and increase the payments some may receive. The new changes affectSupplemental Security Income, or SSI, which provides more than 7 million Americans with monthly benefit checks. Those benefits are for seniors ages 65 and up, or adults and children who are disabled or blind, and who have little or no income or resources. “We already know that the benefit amounts that are available to people receiving SSI are incredibly low,” said Lydia Brown, director of public policy at the National Disability Institute. “They’re not as high as perhaps they could be to fully account for the needs that people have,” Brown said. The maximum federal monthly SSI benefit is currently$943 per eligible individualand $1,415 for an eligible individual and eligible spouse. The changes, which are slated to go into effect Sept. 30, are a “positive move in the right direction,” Brown said. The agency on Thursday announced a new rule to expand the definition of a public-assistance household. Now, households that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, payments and those where not all members receive public assistance will be included. With the change, more people may qualify for SSI, current beneficiaries may see higher payments and individuals who live in public-assistance households may have fewer reporting requirements, according to the Social Security Administration. The previous policy required all household members to receive public assistance. A public-assistance household will be defined as one with both an SSI applicant or beneficiary, as well as at least one other member who receives one or more forms of means-tested public income maintenance payments. “By simplifying our policies and including an additional program geared towards low-income families, such as the SNAP, we are removing significant barriers to accessing SSI,” Social Security Commissioner Martin O’Malley said in a statement. “These changes promote greater equity in our programs.” The definition of a public-assistance household has not been updated in a very long time, according to Darcy Milburn, director of Social Security and health-care policy at The Arc, a nonprofit organization serving people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. “I would characterize this as just good policy and commonsense changes to update this definition,” Milburn said. What’s more, there are many ways in which SSI is still operating under rules devised in the 1980s, said Brown of the National Disability Institute. SNAP is the first public income maintenance benefit to be added to the public-assistance household definition since 1980, according to the Social Security Administration. Other rule changes to help beneficiaries The Social Security Administration is also working to address outdated practices through two other rules that are set to go into effect on Sept. 30. One change will expand theSSI rental subsidy policyto make it less likely that renting at a discounted rate or other rental assistance will affect a beneficiary’s SSI eligibility or monthly payment amount. That policy, which was already available in seven states, will apply nationally. Another change will make it so the SSAno longer counts food assistancetoward support beneficiaries receive from other parties that may reduce their SSI benefit amounts. The Social Security Administration keeps track of the resources SSI beneficiaries receive outside of their federal benefits, formally known as in-kind support and maintenance, or ISM. The purpose of ISM is to reduce SSI benefits if a recipient receives support from family and friends by treating that as unearned income, Milburn said. That support can reduce an individual’s monthly benefit by as much as one-third, Milburn said. And because the SSA keeps track of that support every month, it’s a lot for the agency to monitor, she said. When the changes go into effect this fall, SSI beneficiaries should notice they have less paperwork to fill out, receive more accurate monthly payments and are faced with fewer administrative burdens, Milburn said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/Business/Business-news/social-security-administration-expand-access-certain-benefits-several-rcna151655,NBC,Social Security Administration to expand access to certain benefits through several upcoming changes,,3
173,Business,"Sam Altman is now chairman of a public company. But it’s not OpenAI. On Friday, advanced nuclear fission company Oklo started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which has yet to generate any revenue, went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called AltC Acquisition Corp., founded and led by Altman. Under ticker symbol “OKLO,” shares were trading at just above $15 on Friday morning. Oklo was set to receive more than $306 million in gross proceeds upon closing of the transaction, according to a release. Oklo’s Business model is based on commercializing nuclear fission, the reaction that fuels all nuclear power plants. Instead of conventional reactors, the company aims to usemini nuclear reactorshoused in A-frame structures. Its goal is to sell the energy to end users such as theU.S. Air Forceand big tech companies. Oklo is currently working to build its first small-scale reactor in Idaho, which could eventually power the types of data centers that OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies need to run their AI models and services. Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has said he sees nuclear energy as one of the best ways to solve the problem of growing demand for AI, and the energy that powers the technology, without relying on fossil fuels. Microsoft co-founderBill Gatesand Amazon founderJeff Bezoshave also invested in nuclear plants in recent years. “I don’t see a way for us to get there without nuclear,” Altman told CNBCin 2021. “I mean, maybe we could get there just with solar and storage. But from my vantage point, I feel like this is the most likely and the best way to get there.” In an interview with CNBC Thursday, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte confirmed the company has yet to generate revenue and has no nuclear plants deployed at the moment. He said the company is targeting 2027 for its first plant to come online. Going the SPAC route is risky. So-called reverse mergers becamepopularin the low interest rate days of 2020 and 2021, when tech valuations were soaring and investors were looking for growth over profit. But the SPAC marketcollapsedin 2022 alongside rising rates, and hasn’t recovered. AI-related companies, on the other hand, are thenew darlingsof Wall Street. “SPACs haven’t exactly had the best performances in the past couple of years, so for us to have sort of the outcome that we’ve had here is obviously a function of the work we put in, but also what we’re building and also the fact that the market sees the opportunity sets here,” said DeWitte, who co-founded the company in 2013. “I think it’s very promising on multiple fronts for [the] nuclear, AI, data center push, as well as the energy transition piece.” The company has seen its fair share of regulatory setbacks. In 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission denied Oklo’s application for an Idaho reactor. The company has been working on a new application, which it isn’t aiming to submit to the NRC until early next year, DeWitte said, adding that it’s currently in the “pre-application engagement” stage with the commission. Altman got involved with Oklo while he was president of startup incubator Y Combinator. Oklo went into the program in 2014, after anearlier meetingbetween Altman and DeWitte. In 2015, Altman invested in the company and became chairman. It’s not his only foray into nuclear energy or other infrastructure that could power large-scale AI growth. In 2021, Altman led a $500 million funding round in clean energy firmHelion, which is working to develop and commercialize nuclear fusion. Helion said in ablog postat the time that the capital would go toward its electricity demonstration generator, Polaris, “which we expect to demonstrate net electricity from fusion in 2024.” Altman didn’t respond to a request for comment. In recent years, Altman has also poured money into chip endeavors and investments that could help power the AI tools OpenAI builds. Just before hisbrief ousteras OpenAI CEO in November, he wasreportedlyseeking billions of dollars for a chip venture codenamed “Tigris” to eventually compete withNvidia. In 2018, Altman invested AI chip startup Rain Neuromorphics, based near OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters. The next year OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on Rain’s chips. In December, the U.S. compelled a Saudi Aramco-backed venture capital firm to sell its shares in Rain. DeWitte told CNBC that the data center represents “a pretty exciting opportunity.” “What we’ve seen is there’s a lot of interest with AI, specifically,” he said. “AI compute needs are significant. It opens the door for a lot of different approaches in terms of how people think about designing and developing AI infrastructure.” Hayden Field is a CNBC reporter MacKenzie Sigalos is a technology reporter for CNBC with a focus on cryptocurrency and fintech.",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/sam-altman-takes-nuclear-energy-company-oklo-public-help-power-ai-ambi-rcna151659,NBC,Sam Altman takes nuclear energy company Oklo public to help power his AI ambitions,,3
174,Business,"HONG KONG — A top public relations executive from Chinese technology firmBaiduapologized Thursday after she made comments in a series of videos that critics said glorified a culture of overwork. Baidu’s head of communications, Qu Jing, drew a public outcry inChinaafter she implied in the videos that she was not concerned about her employees as she was “not their mom” and said she only cared about results. She also said that the relationship between her and her subordinates was purely an “employer-employee relationship.” The backlash was swift, with many on social media platforms such as Weibo criticizing Qu as lacking empathy. Qu posted an apology Thursday on her private WeChat account, where she “sincerely apologized to all netizens” and clarified that she had not sought Baidu’s permission before posting the videos. Qu said that her short videos did not represent Baidu’s stance. Baidu operates China’s dominant search engine as well as theErnie bot, an artificial intelligence service similar toChatGPT. “Many of the criticisms are very pertinent, I am reflecting deeply and humbly accept them,” she said. “There are many inappropriate (things said) in the video that caused external misunderstandings about the company’s values and corporate culture, causing serious harm. I sincerely apologize.” Qu also pledged to improve her communication and management style and care more for her colleagues. Baidu did not immediately comment. The videos, which have since been taken down, came at a time when many young people in China arepushing back against a culture of competitionand grueling hours in the workplace. Qu received criticism for a range of subjects she mentioned in the series of short videos on Douyin, the Chinese equivalent of TikTok. In the series, she brought up an incident of certain employees who sent hundreds of complaint letters against her to the office, and threatened to ruin their careers by ensuring that they could never again find a job in the industry. In one of the videos, she criticized an employee who refused to go on a 50-day Business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic. China had implemented strict travel restrictions that at times included weeks of quarantine for travel even within the country. “Why should I take into consideration my employee’s family? I’m not her mother-in law,” Qu said, adding that if employees refused to go on such Business trips then they would not get salary raises or job promotions. Chinese technology firms have long been criticized for their long working hours. A public debate was set off in recent years over the “996” work culture, where employees in technology firms were expected to work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. The issue was also spotlighted after the deaths of two employees of Chinese e-commerce firm Pinduoduo, one of whom collapsed suddenly on the street on her way home from work. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, also faced criticism in 2019 for endorsing the 12-hour workday culture, saying that those who enjoyed their work would not find the “996” practice to be a problem.

175,Business,"WASHINGTON — The Senate late on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a broadaviation billto boostair traffic controller staffing, increase funding to avert runway close-call incidents and speed refunds for canceled flights. The $105 billion, five-year measure reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration. The bill prohibits airlines from charging fees for families to sit together and requires airplanes to be equipped with 25-hour cockpit recording devices — up from the current two-hours — and directs the FAA to deploy advanced airport surface technology to help prevent collisions. The bill adds five daily round-trip flights at busy Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and requires airlines to accept vouchers and credits for at least five years. Efforts to boost aviation safety in the United States have taken on new urgency after a series ofnear-miss incidentsand the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9door plug mid-air emergency. The bill, which is expected to get final approval next week from the House of Representatives, does not raise the mandatory pilot retirement age to 67 as lawmakers had sought to do last year. Earlier this week,lawmakers agreed to revise languageto ensure quick refunds for airline passengers whose flights are canceled who bought non-refundable tickets and who are not seeking alternative flights. The bill raises maximum civil penalties for airline consumer violations from $25,000 per violation to $75,000 and aims to address a shortage of 3,000 air traffic controllers by directing the FAA to implement improved staffing standards and to hire more inspectors, engineers and technical specialists. Congress will not establish minimum seat size requirements, leaving that instead to the FAA. The bill requires the Transportation Department to create a dashboard that shows consumers the minimum seat size for each U.S. airline. Congress alsorejected many other consumer provisionsthe Biden administration sought. The bill also reauthorizes the National Transportation Safety Board and boosts staffing at the safety investigation agency. It also seeks to boost adoption of drones and flying air taxis into the national airspace and extends through Oct. 1 existing government counter-drone authority.",https://www.nbcnews.com/Politics/congress/senate-passes-sweeping-faa-bill-focused-safety-consumer-protections-rcna151592,NBC,Senate passes sweeping FAA bill focused on safety and consumer protections,,3

In a statement obtained by advertising industry publication Ad Age, Tor Myhren, Apple's vice president of marketing, said the ad's message failed to connect. “Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it’s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,” Myhren said. “Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment. CNBCconfirmedthe statement's authenticity. Apple won't run the ad on TV, according to Ad Age. The ad, released Tuesday, features an industrial press crushing mostly analog modes of expression like a trumpet, piano, a camera, cans of paint, and an upright video game console while Sonny & Cher’s “All I Ever Need Is You"" plays in the background. The ad was posted on X by Apple CEO Tim Cook with a caption that read in part; ""Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create."" Online criticism of the ad was nearly universal, with many observers pointing out that while it may have intended to portray the manifold capabilities of the product, it seemed to signify technology as a force  for destroying human agency in creative endeavors.

177,Business,"Credit card holders could be paying more in fees and interest than their travel rewards and other perks are worth, Biden administration officials are arguing, raising scrutiny on loyalty programs that shape millions of people’s spending. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Transportation held a joint hearing in Washington on Thursday that brought together representatives from airlines, financial institutions, unions and consumer advocacy groups to discuss whether new regulations are needed. Regulators arelooking into the promises madearound sign-up bonuses, changes to point values, obstacles in redeeming points and loss of rewards when cards are closed. They’re especially focused on travel rewards, like those offered by airline-branded credit cards that let users rack up frequent flyer miles.Forty-one percent of Americanshave travel rewards credit cards, according to a NerdWallet survey last year. “We’re going to look into how we can make sure companies are being straightforward about what people will get from these frequent flyer miles or loyalty programs when they sign up, and whether people are actually getting the deal that they were promised,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at Thursday’s hearing. The heightened scrutiny on credit card rewards is part of the White House’s broadercrackdown on “junk fees”andother pricing practices, particularly in industries like financial servicesand airlines, that the administration sees as unfairly squeezing consumers and contributing to inflation. In March, the CFPBloweredthe late fees that credit card companies charge,drawing swift industry pushback. Two weeks ago, the Transportation Department said it would require airlines toquickly give cash refundsto passengers whose flights are canceled or seriously delayed. The CFPB, with purview over financial institutions, has cracked down on banks for credit card sign-up bonuses before. Last July, itorderedBank of America to pay more than $100 million for practices including withholding or denying bonus points to tens of thousands of consumers. Federal regulators are now looking more closely at airline credit cards too. Withannual feesas high as $650 and average interest rates of 25.3%, according toLendingTree, they can be much costlier than the average credit card, which in many cases have no annual fees and charge comparatively lower rates, averaging 24.7%. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra told NBC News prior to the hearing that federal authorities could consider regulations, or even law enforcement actions, if they determine companies are breaking their promises to consumers. “We see that for many of these airline rewards programs, credit card companies are charging huge interest rates, sometimes 30% or more. And many consumers actually lose out on these deals. They may be paying way more than the value of the rewards that they accrue,” Chopra said. Even if consumers are able to pay their bills on time and avoid interest payments, consumers have complained about restrictions on using the points they’ve accrued. Buttigieg told NBC News ahead of Thursday’s hearing that he had concerns about “abrupt changes” in the value of points, given the airlines’ control over how many points a flight from, say, New York to Honolulu might cost. Airlines for America, a coalition representing the nation’s largest airlines, said Thursday that there is “fierce competition” within the industry for credit card loyalty, adding that “consumers have the power of choice when picking a carrier for air travel or a credit card for spending, with a wide range of options, to pick what best fits their needs.” The Electronic Payments Coalition, representing credit unions, community banks and payment card networks, points to CFPBdatashowing the value of rewards points has risen from an average 1.4 cents per dollar spent in 2019 to 1.6 cents in 2022. In a statement Thursday, the groupdescribedregulators’ scrutiny of credit card rewards as “politically motivated.” Loyalty programs, which sell points back to consumers at prices they set, have been a big source of revenue for major airlines. Delta Air Linessaidit brought in $6.5 billion in revenue linked to its loyalty programs just last year, and American Airlinessaid80% of its revenue this year will come from loyalty program members. When United Airlines pledged its entire loyalty program for a loan in 2020, itvaluedthe asset at $21.9 billion. Lauren Randall, who lives in Norwalk, Connecticut, told NBC News she recently applied for a travel credit card that offered 40,000 miles at sign-up, only to receive a promotion in the mail just hours later for the very same card offering 60,000 points. She said she called to see if she could receive the better promo but was denied, calling it a “bait and switch.” “It feels like every year, either the seats get smaller, or the prices go up, or there’s some sort of excuse,” Randall said. “It would be great to hold these companies more accountable for the experience and what they promise.” Brian Cheung is a Business and data correspondent for NBC News.

178,Business,"Sinclair, one of the largest owners of broadcast stations in the U.S., is looking to sell more than 30% of its footprint, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has hiredMoelisas its investment banker and has identified more than 60 stations in various regions of the U.S. that it would be willing to sell, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Sinclair owns or operates 185 TV stations in 86 markets. The stations are a mix of affiliates including Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS and the CW. If sold together, their average revenue for 2023 and 2024 is an estimated $1.56 billion, the people said. Sinclair is willing to sell all or some of the stations, which are in top markets like Minneapolis; Portland, Ore.; Pittsburgh; Austin, Texas and Fresno, Calif., among others. Sinclair CEO Chris Ripley said Wednesday that the company is open to offloading parts of its Business, without providing specifics. “As we’ve always stated, we have no sacred cows,” Ripley said during his company’s earnings conference call. “We want to unlock the sum of the parts valuation that we think we’re grossly undervalued for. And to the extent that asset sales makes sense in order to unlock that value and help us de-lever, then that’s something that we’d be open to as well.” The company began officially shopping them in February, one of the people said. Spokespeople for Sinclair and Moelis declined to comment. Sinclair is also exploring options for its Tennis Channel, a cable TV network that features the sport andpickleball matches, the people said.Bloombergearlier reported that development. Broadcast TV station groups have suffered in the past five years as millions of Americans have canceled traditional pay TV. Most stations make money from so-called retransmission fees, paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors, such as Comcast, DirecTV, and Charter, for the right to carry the stations. Sinclair has lost more than 70% of its market value in the last five years. The company’s market capitalization is about $975 million with an enterprise value of about $4.7 billion. Last year, Sinclair rebranded and reorganized, splitting the company into two operating units — Local Media, which focuses on the stations, and Ventures, which houses Tennis Channel but can also act as an investment vehicle. The split in the company divisions, and the recent sale process for some of its stations, stems from tension within the Smith family, the shareholders and the board directors who helped build Sinclair, some of the people said. The stations are up for sale in the months before the 2024 election, which usually draws high political advertising revenue for broadcast TV companies. Sinclair said during earnings on Wednesday that it pre-booked $77 million in political advertising for the second half of the year through Election Day, compared with $21 million at the same point in 2020, the last time former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden were on the ticket. The company’s overall revenue and advertising revenue both rose slightly during the first quarter. Sinclair’s stock was up 12% on Thursday. Sinclair’s broadcast stations have been known for having a conservative editorial voice, and the company faced backlash in 2018 afterrequiringsome of its stations to read promos criticizing the media about “fake stories.” The process also comes after Sinclair faced headaches in the regional sports networks Business. Sinclair acquired the largest portfolio of regional sports networks from Disney in 2019 for $10.6 billion, including $8.8 billion in debt. Between ramped-up cord-cutting and the hefty debt load, Diamond Sports, the independently run and unconsolidated subsidiary of Sinclair, soughtbankruptcyprotection last year.

Last year, BetterHelp agreed to pay $7.8 million to settle FTC chargesthat it co-opted user data, including personal health questions, for advertising purposes, sharing the sensitive information with social media platforms like Facebook and Snapchat. The FTC accused BetterHelp of failing to properly obtain consumers’ consent before it did so. BetterHelp did not admit to the charges. It said in a statement this week that was “deeply committed to the privacy of our members and we value the trust people put in us by using our services.” Eligible refund customers include anyone who paid for services on BetterHelp or its affiliated websites, like MyTherapist, Teen Counseling, Faithful Counseling, Pride Counseling, iCounseling, Regain and Terappeuta, from Aug. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2020.

180,Business,"A federal jury in New York on Thursday convicted an investor ofinsider tradingin the stock of a shell company ahead of its announcement in October 2021 that it would merge withTrump Media. The investor,Bruce Garelick, had been on the board of directors of the publicly traded company,Digital World Acquisition Corp., at the time he was accused of sharing and exploiting non-public information with others about its plans to merge with then-privately held Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app. Trump Media’s majority shareholder is former PresidentDonald Trump, who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case against Garelick in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But Garelick’s trial, which began on April 30, took place just blocks away from where Trump is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court on criminal charges related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Two co-defendants of Garelick, the brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on April 3. Jurors in Garelick’s case began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and a defense lawyer. After several hours of deliberation Thursday, jurors returned guilty verdicts on the five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy that the 54-year-old Garelick faced. Garelick, who testified at his trial, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 12. Garelick was an investment advisor to Michael Shvartsman’s venture capital firm, Rocket One Capital. Prosecutors said Garelick shared non-public material information about DWAC’s merger plans with Trump Media with the Shvartsman brothers in 2021 after joining DWAC’s board. All three men then bought up DWAC stock based on that non-public information and then sold their shares after the price soared following the announcement of the deal to combine with Trump Media, prosecutors said. Garelick made a profit of just $49,000 on the illicit trades, but the Shvartsmans earned a whopping $23 million, according to prosecutors. “Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement Thursday. “When he was given that opportunity, Garelick promised to keep the information about DWAC’s interest in acquiring Trump Media secret and not use it to trade in the stock market. Garelick was also given a seat on DWAC’s board, which gave him direct access to additional non-public information regarding the acquisition,” Williams said. “As a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,” the top prosecutor said. “Garelick’s federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.” DWAC and Trump Media completed their merger in late March. Public trading of the company’s stock under the new ticker DJT began a day later. Last week, theSecurities and Exchange Commissioncharged Trump Media’s auditor with what the regulator said was“massive fraud” involving the auditor’s accounting work for hundreds of publicly traded companies, affecting 1,500 SEC filings. The auditor,BF Borgers CPA, and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, agreed to be permanently suspended from practicing as accountants before the SEC, and to pay a combined $14 million in civil penalties.

181,Business,"A new strategy has emerged in the battle to ban smoking in casinos: the shareholder vote. Shareholders atBoyd Gaming,Bally’s EntertainmentandCaesars Entertainmentwill put on the ballot at the respective casino companies proposals to force them to study the costs associated with permitting smoking indoors — and whether going smoke-free could save money. The proposals are sponsored by Trinity Health, a nonprofit health care network, and the Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation. Trinity Health, based in Livonia, Michigan, has used its shareholder status tofight for various health initiativesdespite the fact that it owns just a tiny fraction of these companies. For example, public records show Trinity owns just 440 shares of Bally’s stock, or about 0.001% of the company. Boyd, Bally’s and Caesars fought to keep the proposals out of the proxy materials distributed to shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission denied the casinos’ requests, and the proposals as well as the rationale behind them were delivered to all shareholders. Boyd will face avote over a smoke-free assessmentat its annual shareholder meeting Thursday. Bally’s holds its annual meeting on May 16, and Caesars will follow with its own meeting, likely in June. The three companies collectively operate 75 U.S. casinos that permit indoor smoking, where state law allows. About 14 states permit indoor smoking in commercial casinos. States like Nevada and New Jersey have prohibited indoor smoking more broadly but carved out exceptions for casinos. Legislation to end indoor smoking at casinos is in various stages in several states across the country, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Advocates for smoking bans point to research by C3 Gaming that concluded smoke-free casinos generate more revenue and outperform competitors that allow smoking. Proposal sponsors argue shareholders should know how much casinos pay in higher health insurance premiums for employees, greater maintenance costs and keeping away customers who hate the smoke. In its proxy, Boyd argues it’s seen a negative impact in states that banned indoor smoking. It argues these decisions are best left up to the properties to follow local trends and says if shareholders succeed in implementing a ban (which Boyd claims is the true goal in forcing an assessment), the company will lose customers to competitors who continue to allow smoking. Caesars board member Jan Jones Blackhurst said Wednesday at the SBC Summit North America, an online gaming conference, that she believes the decision of whether to ban smoking in casinos should be left up to governments. She pointed out that experience has shown that smoke-free casinos can take an economic hit. “Generally, if you look across the United States, when casinos prohibit smoking, revenues fall anywhere from 20% to 25%, which also then have a huge layoff factor with people starting to lose their jobs,” she said. Unions are mixed in their responses. While some worry about the potential of job losses, the United Auto Workers, which represents more than 10,000 table game dealers across the country, has ramped up its efforts in the fight against in-casino smoking, citing secondhand exposure for employees. TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionsays “no amount of exposure to secondhand smoke is safe and the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is through 100% smoke free indoor air environments.” The U.S. surgeon general says that many common practices found in casinos such as separating smoking versus non-smoking sections, cleaning the air and ventilating buildings are not effective protections against secondhand smoke. Casino operator Parx, which runs locations in Pennsylvania, decided to stay smoke-free during the Covid pandemic at its property in Bensalem, north of Philadelphia. It competes with four other local casinos that allow smoking indoors but said it hasn’t seen its market share suffer. “Financially, we know we’ve lost some customers, but we also know we’ve gained some customers. We don’t think we’ve seen a significant impact either way,” Parx spokesperson Marc Oppenheimer told CNBC. Instead, the company said it focuses on guest satisfaction scores and surveys that indicate a boost to employee morale. In Las Vegas,MGM Resortsopened the first casino resort on the Strip to prohibit indoor smoking and even smoking on the pool deck. On its website, the property declares, “Here at Park MGM, we’re not afraid to be different and, as you may have noticed, we’re all about what’s fresh. Now, that includes the air you breathe.” For now, Park MGM is the exception, but smoke-free advocates hope soon, it’ll be the rule.

182,Business,"AConsumer Financial Protection Bureauregulation thatpromisedto save Americans billions of dollars inlate feeson credit cards faces a last-ditch effort to stave off its implementation. Led by theU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the card industry in Marchsuedthe CFPB in federal court to prevent the new rule from taking effect. That effort, whichbouncedbetween venues in Texas and Washington, D.C., for weeks, is now about to reach a milestone: a judge in the Northern District of Texas is expected to announce by Friday evening whether the court will grant the industry’s request for a freeze. That could hold up the regulation, which wouldslashwhat most banks can charge in late fees to $8 per incident, just days before it was totake effecton Tuesday. “We should get some clarity soon about whether the rule is going to be allowed to go into effect,” saidTobin Marcus, lead policy analyst at Wolfe Research. The credit card regulation is part of PresidentJoe Biden’sbroader election-year war against what he deemsjunk fees. Big card issuers have steadily raised the cost of late fees since 2010, profiting off users with low credit scores whorack up$138 in fees annually per card on average,accordingto CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. As expected, the industry has mounted a campaign to derail the regulations, deeming them a misguided effort thatredistributescosts to those who pay their bills on time, and ultimately harms those it purports to benefit by making it more likely for users to fall behind. Up for grabs is the$10 billionin fees per year that the CFPB estimates the rule would save American families by pushing down late penalties to $8 from a typical $32 per incident. Card issuers includingCapital OneandSynchronyhave already talked about efforts to offset the revenue hit they would face if the rule takes effect. They could do so by raising interest rates, adding new fees for things like paper statements, or changing who they choose to lend to. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said last month that, if implemented, the CFPB rule would impact his bank’s revenue for a “couple of years” as the company takes “mitigating actions” to raise revenue elsewhere. “Some of these mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway,” Fairbank told analysts during the company’s first-quarter earnings call. “We are planning on additional actions once we learn more about where the litigation settles out.” Like someotherobservers, Wolfe Research’s Marcus believes the Chamber of Commerce is likely to prevail in its efforts to hold off the rule, either via the Northern District of Texas or through the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. If granted, a preliminary injunction could hold up the rule until the dispute is settled, possibly through a lengthy trial. The industry group, which includes Washington, D.C.-based trade associations like the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association, filed its lawsuit in Texas because it is widely viewed as a friendlier venue for corporations, Marcus said. “I would be very surprised if [Texas Judge Mark T.] Pittman denies that injunction on the merits,” he said. “One way or another, I think implementation is going to be blocked before the rule is supposed to go into effect.” The CFPB declined to comment, and the Chamber of Commerce didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://www.nbcnews.com/Business/consumer/cfpb-rule-americans-10-billion-year-late-fees-faces-possible-last-minu-rcna151523,NBC,CFPB rule to save Americans $10 billion a year in late fees faces possible last-minute freeze,,3
183,Politics,"Attorneys for former President Donald Trump sought to pierce   Thursday, casting the adult film actor as someone whose retelling of their alleged sexual encounter was rife with inconsistencies and driven by a desire to harm him. Trump’s lawyer Susan Necheles asked Daniels on the stand in Manhattan criminal court in New York City about making “a lot of money” from her story over the years, striking deals worth a million dollars or more. She also needled Daniels over the different ways she has described the encounter in magazine and prime-time interviews, as well as in the courtroom. Daniels pushed back, saying that while she made a living speaking out against Trump, “I was not selling myself to anyone.” Daniels’ story is   of the prosecution's hush money case against Trump. The bid to silence her in the waning days of the 2016 presidential race came as Trump’s campaign feared he could not withstand further damage after a recording of him talking about inappropriately “grabbing” women threatened to derail his candidacy. Trump has been charged with 34 state counts related to falsifying Business records, which prosecutors say were used to obscure the payments to Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He has also denied having had an affair with Daniels. Here's what you missed on Day 14 of the criminal trial. Necheles pressed Daniels about varying details in her retelling of the 2006 encounter with Trump, such as her saying she felt light-headed, which Daniels did not include in media interviews. On Thursday, Necheles, the Trump attorney, asked Daniels more than two dozen times about her account, casting it as a fabrication used to extort money at a sensitive time for Trump. Necheles said that Daniels “wanted to make money” from the attention and that she had even made it the “centerpiece” of her 2018 book. “You were threatening that you would try to hurt President Trump politically by telling this story if he didn’t give you money, right?” Necheles asked. She also pointed to merchandise Daniels marketed online, including a $40 “Stormy Saint of Indictments” candle and a “Stormy Daniels Political Power” comic book. Necheles further noted that Daniels appeared to celebrate Trump’s indictment in the case by tweeting the same day about popping champagne. “That was me doing my job,” Daniels said in response. The defense also suggested that prosecutors had worked to shape Daniels’ testimony before she took the stand for the first time Tuesday. Necheles asked her whether she was supposed to include certain details at their urging and from her book.Trump’s attorneys have sought throughout the trial to portray certain witnesses as selectively highlighting facts to help the Manhattan district attorney’s case. “There’s nothing wrong with detail,” Daniels said Thursday. “My story never changed,” she said later. Another Trump attorney, Todd Blanche, cited Daniels' lurid testimony of the alleged encounter with Trump as he renewed a bid for a mistrial, arguing it was prejudicial when Daniels described “an imbalance of power” between herself and Trump, even as she said she did not feel physically threatened, and when she recalled a “spanking” with a rolled-up magazine. “None of that is information that goes to motive,” Blanche said. The judge rejected the mistrial motion. He also dismissed a request by the defense to loosen the rules on the gag order against Trump. Two new witnesses who worked for Trump took the stand Thursday under subpoena: a Trump Organization employee and Trump’s former executive assistant in the White House. Both gave compelling testimony about Trump’s micromanagement of his affairs, such as his signing off on $6,000 annual dues to a golf club, for which he wrote ""PAY ASAP OK"" on the invoice. Madeleine Westerhout, the former White House assistant, described Trump's habits, including how he liked to keep his Oval Office desk pristine for meetings and used the dining room as his “working office.” There, he would be “working, reading, going over documents,” she said, noting that while he kept things organized, he did have a lot of papers. “I found that he always knew where things were,” Westerhout said. She said he “liked hard-copy documents” and, to her knowledge, did not have an email address. Westerhout left the White House after she spoke disparagingly about Trump’s family at a meeting with reporters that she believed was off the record; her comments were reported publicly. In contrast to Daniels, Westerhout spoke warmly of Trump, painting a picture of a family man who cared deeply about his wife, Melania Trump. Rebecca Manochio, the Trump Organization employee who took the stand Thursday, testified about how checks were handled both before and during Trump's time in office. She described putting together checks with their invoices for Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg to sign, which he continued to do after Trump took office. Certain checks required Trump’s signature, Manochio said, and she recalled at least one occasion when she sent just one. Trump took notes and gazed ahead as Manochio told the court that roughly once a week she would send checks by FedEx for Trump to sign at the White House. She then mailed the checks that Westerhout would handle at the White House. A third new witness for the day — Tracey Menzies, an executive at HarperCollins — testified to the accuracy of certain excerpts from a book by Trump that her company published, “Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and in Life.” An excerpt that was introduced into the court record focused on Trump’s urging to “value loyalty above everything” at the Trump Organization and on how he claimed to “go out of my way” to make life “miserable” for a woman he said “was very disloyal.” Westerhout described Trump’s process for using Twitter, now X, when he was in the White House. She said that besides Trump, only deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino had access to the president's account in 2017 and that Trump had a distinct style. “There were certain words that he liked to capitalize … and he liked to use exclamation points,” Westerhout said. “It’s my understanding that he liked to use the Oxford comma.” She also recalled how Michael Cohen met with Trump at the White House but did not specifically remember seeing him there. The meeting is a key event in the prosecution's narrative of an election interference plot. Westerhout described Trump as detail-oriented and said he preferred to sign documents himself using a Sharpie or a Pentel felt-tip pen. She recounted that Trump would sign every check by hand in his office and return them to her in a folder. Trump signed a lot of material, Westerhout said while being questioned by Necheles. She also talked about a text message she sent to Hope Hicks, a top aide to Trump, asking, “Hey — the president wants to know if you called David Pecker again?” Pecker, a former publisher of the National Enquirer, previously testified about his role in a scheme to “catch and kill” stories potentially damaging to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, including an account by Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who said she had a monthslong relationship with Trump starting about a decade before the election. After the jury left the courtroom Thursday, Trump's attorney Blanche mentioned that the DA's office had informed him that prosecutors will no longer call McDougal to testify.

184,Politics,"Two Russian online film distributors, including a company owned by Nasdaq-listed internet giant Yandex have been charged with offenses under the country’s so-called LGBT propaganda law, a notice on a Moscow court’s website said. Russia last year   its restrictions on the promotion of what it calls LGBT propaganda amid a broader clampdown on queer rights, which President Vladimir Putin has sought to portray as evidence of moral decay in Western countries. The companies, Kinopoisk and Restream Media, face an administrative case for the “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships” or “gender reassignment” online, according to the notice posted on Wednesday. Separate charges were filed on Wednesday against two Kinopoisk and Restream Media executives for the same offense, an online court notice showed. Yandex-owned Kinopoisk and Restream Media, majority-owned by digital services giant Rostelecom have both been   under a similar article banning the “demonstration” of LGBTQ relationships to minors. That resulted from them listing films such as “Bridget Jones’s Diary” and “Perfect Strangers” without an 18+ label. A spokesperson for Kinopoisk told Reuters that the charge was related to its listing of the U.S. television series “Supergirl,” which features a same-sex relationship, and that the company planned to challenge the court ruling. “The laws and regulations as currently drafted do not provide sufficient objective criteria for determining propaganda of non-traditional relationships,” the company said in a statement provided to Reuters. “We hope that the current practice of fines against online cinemas will be revised to warnings.” Restream Media did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-Politics-and-policy/two-russian-online-film-distributors-charged-lgbt-propaganda-law-rcna151472,NBC,Two Russian online film distributors charged under 'LGBT propaganda' law,,0
185,Politics,"President Joe Biden is trying to thread the needle on Israel’s war against Hamas, but his   to Benjamin Netanyahu’s government left some in Washington wondering whether he’s lost that thread. “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,” Biden   Wednesday. “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities — that deal with that problem.” In point of fact, Israel is conducting limited military operations in Rafah, the Gaza city where more than 1 million Palestinians have clustered since the war began in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack on the Jewish state. Biden said Israel has not yet crossed a “red line” by going into population centers. But at the same time the Biden administration is delaying an official certification that U.S. weapons aren’t being used to undercut humanitarian efforts to protect civilians, the president is drawing a new rhetorical line in the sand. Some in his own party see that as counterproductive to Biden’s policy and political aims. He would like the war to conclude as soon as possible, with the release of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas, and he would like for pro-Palestinian activists to stop hammering him at home as he seeks re-election. “The problem is this message that they’re sending can’t accomplish both of those things,” said one Democratic lawmaker who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid criticism of Biden’s position. “Because now, if you want Hamas to release the hostages and they see the U.S. pulling back, it relieves the pressure on Hamas.” This lawmaker said that figures to lengthen the war, rather than bringing a conclusion, which in turn threatens to extend Biden’s domestic political quandary. “If the hostages are not going to be released, then the war is going to continue, with or without U.S. missiles,” the lawmaker said. Republicans were quick to condemn Biden’s position. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently worked with the Biden White House to enact an aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan,   that he hopes Biden’s remarks were a “senior moment.” And in an interview with North Carolina’s Spectrum News 1, former President Donald Trump said he “wouldn’t do what Biden did.” “He just abandoned Israel,” Trump said.  But progressives welcomed what they saw as a turn in the right direction.  “Biden has taken the position that 37 Democrats did in voting no on offensive weapons to Gaza that could be used for an invasion in Rafah,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a co-chair of Biden’s campaign. “That now is the mainstream Democratic position, and the recent vote on the offensive weapons to Israel will be seen akin to the Iraq War one.” Last month, Democrats voted 173-37 for a stand-alone measure that provided aid to Israel, including for offensive weapons, before it was wrapped into the larger package of foreign military assistance that Biden signed into law. If Biden is mainstreaming the progressive view, he’s doing so at the potential cost of standing with roughly 20% of his party’s House contingent and against the vast majority of Republican officials inside and outside Congress. The question for Biden as he tries to manage Israel’s war from afar is whether he’ll net more support at home by moving closer to the pro-Palestinian progressives who have given him fits since the start of the war. Adult film star Stormy Daniels returned to the stand in  , pushing back during cross-examination on his defense attorney’s attempts to discredit her in sometimes bizarre and uncomfortable exchanges.  Trump’s attorney Susan Necheles grilled Daniels about the $130,000 nondisclosure agreement she signed with Trump’s then-attorney Michael Cohen near the close of the 2016 election, and tried to poke holes in her now-sworn statements about the sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, which he denies.  Necheles asked her about the number of porn films she’s written and directed, and said, “You have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex.” “Wow. That’s not how I would put it,” Daniels replied. “The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room” with Trump. She added, “If that story was untrue, I would’ve written it to be a lot better.” Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s former White House executive assistant, was called as a witness later in the day. 💲 Will Trump take the stand? He previously said that he “absolutely” would testify, but has since softened those comments.  Two of Trump’s   come with politically fraught complications: the Republican governors who would choose their successors. If Trump goes with   of Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis would be in line to select his replacement — perhaps immediately if Rubio resigns and relocates to avoid the constitutional hang-up of having both candidates on the ticket residing in the same state.

Both governors have  ,   with Trump, raising doubts about whether the people they appoint would meet the often rigid right-wing standards of his MAGA movement. And while the succession dynamic will not necessarily sink Rubio’s or Vance’s chances of being selected, it is the subject of speculative conversation in both states. DeSantis and Trump are coming off a bitter clash for the GOP presidential nomination. Though there are signs of détente, enough trust issues remain that the idea of handing DeSantis the power of a Senate appointment is one that Trump world is approaching cautiously.

186,Politics,"The   is expected to propose a rule Thursday that would accelerate the pace at which certain migrants could be processed and denied asylum after having crossing the southern border, according to two sources familiar with the decision. The regulation, which had been in the works for months and will be published by the Department of Homeland Security, seeks to cut down on illegal border crossings. It would specifically target people who are deemed ineligible for asylum because of criminal records or who are assessed to be national security risks, one of the sources said.  The asylum process  , and the proposed rule will aim to shorten that time substantially for those deemed ineligible. It is not considered the major executive action NBC News has been previewing  , which could still materialize in the near term. The White House declined to comment. As the Biden administration   on the border that could affect the asylum process, up Pennsylvania Avenue, Senate Democrats had an initial closed-door conversation Wednesday about what legislative steps they could take. “I think the starting point for the discussion is the bipartisan deal that was negotiated, so we’ll start there. Do we subtract a little bit, do we add a little bit? We don’t know yet,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NBC News after the meeting. “Everybody realizes we are going to have a meaningful discussion about it in the coming weeks.” NBC News reported Monday that Democrats in the Senate could force “messaging” votes on immigration and border-related provisions that Republicans would most likely block. Republicans blocked the bipartisan package negotiated by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., in February at the behest of former President Donald Trump.  But asked about the administration’s actions during his leadership news conference Wednesday, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Biden administration and congressional Democrats “agree” that “the best thing to deal with the problem on the border is pass legislation.” “We have strong bipartisan drafted legislation,” Schumer said. “If Republicans are serious about fixing the border, join us — we can only pass it with Republican votes, Democratic votes and Republican votes, and that’s what we should do.” Senators threw out ideas during the closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to multiple Democrats who spoke with NBC News.  Earlier Wednesday, a collection of progressive and Hispanic lawmakers   to streamline pathways to citizenship for long-term, undocumented immigrants and expressed concerns with the administration’s potential plans to restrict some asylum through unilateral action. “As the Biden administration considers executive actions on immigration, we must not return to failed Trump-era policies aimed at banning asylum and moving us backward,” Sen.

187,Politics,"The Democratic National Committee is making new tech investments to bolster its efforts to reach young voters and voters of color in an increasingly fragmented environment,   laying out the party’s strategies in the months leading up to the general election. Bolstered by the over $192 million they have amassed in the first quarter of this year, Democrats have doled out millions to acquire data and new technology to specifically target voters in battleground states and create a “data infrastructure” that can equally be used by national and state parties.  The party has invested $2 million this cycle in cellphone data to better target voters in battleground states, according to the memo, which touted expanding its cellphone coverage on voter lists from 30% of voters in 2016 to over 80% now. An additional $2 million annually has been invested in “models and commercial data to better understand voters.” The Democrats point to the Wisconsin state Supreme Court race as evidence of the benefit of having such data on file, citing the 1.4 million calls and texts Wisconsin Democrats made to support candidates last year, including Janet Protasiewicz, who was elected to the court. The DNC says that so far, it has made 1.2 million calls and sent 5.4 million texts to engage voters and promote events, recruit for organizing activities and support voter registration efforts in battleground states. It plans to invest more in its relational organizing programs to better reach young voters and voters of color before the election. That includes a Wisconsin-based pilot program that has been engaging with youth voters on college campuses in Green Bay, Madison, Milwaukee and Eau Claire. Ahead of President Joe Biden’s campaign event in Racine, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, attendees were trained in how to use a relational organizing app, REACH, which the campaign described as a program helping “voters connect with people they already know about the importance of the election.” The bet is that friends and peers will be best placed to persuade on-the-fence people in their social networks to back Biden. “Over the last several months, REACH has been used successfully by Team Biden-Harris supporters and volunteers in the Black community as part of a first-of-its-kind relational organizing program in Milwaukee,” Garren Randolph, the campaign manager for the Wisconsin Democratic Coordinated Campaign, wrote in a memo this week. The DNC also touted other investments in its memo. , which Biden comfortably won in 2020, Democrats are also broadening their investments to target traditionally red states. This election cycle, the party has invested more than $4.5 million in its Red State Fund, which allocates resources for programs in traditionally Republican states. Kentucky, where Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won re-election last year, is among the red states that have seen big increases in national party investment. And the DNC also touted new investments in election security measures. It said in its memo it’s making seven-figure investments in a “robust voter protection operation,” including launching an online training system comprised of 57 videos, training voting staff members in topics from election administration and ballot curing to organizing and federal law. In addition, the party said it will continue to support a voter assistance hotline. It said that it received over 28,000 calls in the 2022 midterms and that so far this cycle it has received more than 9,000.

188,Politics,"A federal jury in New York on Thursday convicted an investor of   in the stock of a shell company ahead of its announcement in October 2021 that it would merge with  . The investor,  , had been on the board of directors of the publicly traded company,  , at the time he was accused of sharing and exploiting non-public information with others about its plans to merge with then-privately held Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app. Trump Media’s majority shareholder is former President  , who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case against Garelick in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But Garelick’s trial, which began on April 30, took place just blocks away from where Trump is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court on criminal charges related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Two co-defendants of Garelick, the brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on April 3. Jurors in Garelick’s case began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and a defense lawyer. After several hours of deliberation Thursday, jurors returned guilty verdicts on the five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy that the 54-year-old Garelick faced. Garelick, who testified at his trial, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 12. Garelick was an investment advisor to Michael Shvartsman’s venture capital firm, Rocket One Capital. Prosecutors said Garelick shared non-public material information about DWAC’s merger plans with Trump Media with the Shvartsman brothers in 2021 after joining DWAC’s board. All three men then bought up DWAC stock based on that non-public information and then sold their shares after the price soared following the announcement of the deal to combine with Trump Media, prosecutors said. Garelick made a profit of just $49,000 on the illicit trades, but the Shvartsmans earned a whopping $23 million, according to prosecutors. “Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement Thursday. “When he was given that opportunity, Garelick promised to keep the information about DWAC’s interest in acquiring Trump Media secret and not use it to trade in the stock market. Garelick was also given a seat on DWAC’s board, which gave him direct access to additional non-public information regarding the acquisition,” Williams said. “As a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,” the top prosecutor said. “Garelick’s federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.” DWAC and Trump Media completed their merger in late March. Public trading of the company’s stock under the new ticker DJT began a day later.

189,Politics,"Adult film star   returned to the stand in Donald Trump's  Thursday, pushing back during cross-examination against his defense attorney's attempts to discredit her in sometimes bizarre and uncomfortable exchanges. After she was done testifying in Manhattan criminal court in New York, Trump's attorney Todd Blanche moved again for a mistrial, saying she'd changed her story and been allowed to testify about matters that were irrelevant to the case. He also asked the judge to waive Trump's gag order to allow him to respond to her testimony publicly. State Judge Juan Merchan denied both requests. “My concern is not just with protecting Ms. Daniels or a witness who has already testified. My concern is protecting the integrity of the proceedings as a whole,” Merchan said of the gag order request. Trump blasted the judge's actions on Thursday, calling them ""a disgrace"" to reporters in the courthouse afterwards. ""I'm innocent and I'm being held in this court with a corrupt judge,"" he said. Daniels took to social media Thursday night with a not-so-subtle dig at Trump. ""Real men respond to testimony by being sworn in and taking the stand in court. Oh...wait. Nevermind,""  . It's unclear   in his own defense. When Daniels was on the stand, Trump attorney Susan Necheles grilled her about the $130,000 nondisclosure agreement she signed with Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen near the close of the 2016 election and tried to poke holes in her now-sworn statements about the sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, which he denies. Necheles asked her about the number of porn films she has written and directed and said, “You have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex.” “Wow. That’s not how I would put it,"" Daniels replied. ""The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room” with Trump. She added, ""If that story was untrue, I would’ve written it to be a lot better.” Necheles and Daniels sparred over minor inconsistencies in Daniels’ stories, including her having said in a 2011 interview that she and Trump had dinner together while she now maintains they never actually ate. “I had dinner in the room, but we never got any food, and we never ate anything,"" Daniels said. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger noted on re-direct examination that the article with the 2011 interview said the piece had been ""lightly edited."" Necheles also sought to dispute Daniels' claims that she was scared when she saw Trump waiting for her in bed in a T-shirt and boxers after she got out of the bathroom, implying that a porn actor wouldn't be caught off-guard by someone in underwear. Necheles asked whether it was the first time in her life someone had made a pass at her. Daniels said it was the first time with somebody ""twice my age and bigger than me"" who had a bodyguard outside the door. “You wanted money from President Trump, right?” Necheles asked earlier in their exchange. “No,” Daniels answered. “I never asked for money from President Trump,” she said. “I never asked for money from anyone in particular. I asked for money to tell my story” in 2016, and it was Cohen who approached her attorney with the NDA. She said she thought the agreement was “a perfect solution,” giving her a paper trail and peace of mind without having to tell her story publicly. Daniels also acknowledged that she was irate when Cohen appeared to be stalling on paying the money but that he eventually paid. Necheles also asked about a statement she signed in 2018 denying she'd had an affair with Trump after The Wall Street Journal wrote about her NDA. Daniels said her lawyer had given her the statement and told her she had to sign it. She said she decided she wanted to tell her story later that year, after Cohen began talking about her publicly. Asked whether she'd promised people she'd be instrumental in putting Trump in jail, Daniels said, ""No."" Necheles then asked her about a social media post in which someone had called her a human toilet, and Daniels responded, ""Exactly! Making me the best person to flush the orange turd down."" Necheles asked whether that meant she'd be instrumental in getting rid of him. Daniels said it was ""hyperbole.""  ""I'm also not a toilet,"" she said. Daniels spoke more slowly and seemed more confident Thursday than on her first day on the stand, but her voice shook some when Necheles asked her about various mean tweets she has been the target of, including ones referring to her as an ""aging harlot"" and a “disgusting degenerate prostitute.” “When somebody attacks me I’m going to defend myself,” she said, sounding like she was on the verge of tears. After Daniels was done testifying, her lawyer Clark Brewster told NBC News she was ""shaken"" by the ordeal and ""relieved"" to be done. “She was cross-examined over communications over years, and having your memory challenged like that and having to respond to questions immediately with recall is not easy, and it was quite an accomplishment,” Brewster said, adding, “She did a remarkable job of getting her testimony across.” During the discussion about the defense’s renewed request for a mistrial, Merchan said he was surprised Trump's lawyers didn’t object to certain parts of Daniels’ testimony. He cited one part where Daniels said Trump told her: “I thought we were getting somewhere, we were talking, and I thought you were serious about what you wanted. If you ever want to get out of that trailer park.” “I was offended because I never lived in a trailer park,” Daniels said. The judge said he struck that part of her testimony. Trump sat with his eyes closed for parts of Daniels' testimony. He was accompanied to court by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who left in the late morning. On his way out of court, Scott took some jabs at three people whom Trump is prevented from criticizing by the gag order in the case — Judge Juan Merchan's daughter, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's wife and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. Scott didn’t name any of the three, but it was clear from his remarks — including saying ""the judge's daughter is a political operative"" — to whom he was referring. It's unclear whether prosecutors will try to argue the comments violated the gag order. The ruling bars Trump from making ""or directing others to make"" comments about individual prosecutors or relatives of people involved with the case, in addition to remarks about witnesses and jurors. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s former White House executive assistant, testified later in the day that she had seen Trump sign checks in the Oval Office and that he had been “very upset” by Daniels’ claims. Westerhout said she got to know Trump while she was working at the Republican National Committee in 2016. She said there was concern at the RNC in October 2016 after the release of the so-called ""Access Hollywood"" tape, a 2005 recording of Trump saying he can grope women without their consent. Asked whether there were conversations at the RNC about potentially replacing Trump as the Republican nominee at that time, Westerhout said there were. Trump remained the nominee and won the election, and she said she helped the president-elect schedule meetings at Trump Tower, which is what led to her White House job. Her duties included acting as an intermediary between Trump and his company the Trump Organization, coordinating with Rhona Graff, Trump's assistant there, on issues that needed his or the company's attention, like his travel schedule, mail or phone calls.  She said she asked Graff for a list of Trump's contacts, which Graff forwarded to her. The list included information for Cohen and  , the former National Enquirer publisher who testified he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress scandalous stories about Trump, including Daniels' claim. Westerhout said Trump was ""very upset"" when the Daniels story became public. She broke down in tears as she recalled losing her job in August 2019, after she   about Trump's family at a dinner with reporters that she believed to be confidential. She called the incident a mistake and said, ""I've learned a lot from my experience."" She also defended her former boss, saying she believed he has been treated unfairly. She will continue her testimony Friday. After Daniels was done testifying, Blanche told the judge that she'd changed her story by saying she felt there was a power imbalance between them and that she blacked out and was light-headed when they began having sex. He also said there was no reason for prosecutors to have asked her about supposedly spanking him with a magazine before the encounter or for Daniels to have testified that Trump did not use a condom. ""That has nothing to do with the false business record, but it’s so prejudicial. It’s a dog whistle for rape,” Blanche said. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told Merchan: “Those messy details, that is motive. That is Mr. Trump’s motive” for buying her silence. He also suggested that Trump could rebut the story under oath. “If they want to offer testimony that the sex never happened, that’s their prerogative,” he said. He also said there were some ""very salacious details that were intentionally omitted because we did not have the desire to embarrass the defendant.” Merchan said he agreed with Blanche that there shouldn’t have been questions or answers about the condom, but noted that there was no objection from attorneys to that line of questioning at the time. The judge also pointed out that Blanche had said in his opening statement that Trump didn’t have sexual relations with Daniels. “Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe. Donald Trump, who denies that there was an encounter, or Stormy Daniels, who claims that there was,” Merchan said. In addition to the sexual encounter, which Daniels said happened after she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, she told jurors that Trump made a sexual advance in 2007, which she rejected. Four years later, she said, a mysterious man warned her to “ ” after she gave an interview to a magazine about their first encounter. Daniels said the article never ran thanks to Trump's then-“fixer” and lawyer Cohen. Cohen later paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about her claim. Trump's reimbursement of that money to Cohen is at the heart of the criminal case against Trump, who is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to the repayment. He has pleaded not guilty. Daniels was followed on the stand by Rebecca Manochio, a Trump Organization employee who was an assistant to the company's former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. She said that after Trump went to the White House, she would FedEx checks for him to sign and then get them to the proper person at the company when they were returned. Her testimony was used to enter records relating to Trump's checks to Cohen. After Manochio, prosecutors called Tracy Menzies, an executive at HarperCollins Publishers. She was brought in to read into the record from a book Trump co-authored for the company called ""Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life."" One of the 2007 book's chapters was titled ""Do Not Trust Anyone."" ""I just can't stomach disloyalty,"" the book reads, mentioning a woman who had been disloyal. ""I go out of my way to make her life miserable,” the book says. “My motto is 'Always get even. When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.'” The DA's office is nearing its final set of witnesses. Steinglass estimated this week that prosecutors would be done presenting their case by May 21. One person who won’t be testifying is Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model who claims she had a monthslong affair with Trump that began in 2006 and was paid $150,000 to keep quiet in 2016 by the National Enquirer. Trump has denied her claim. Blanche told Merchan that prosecutors informed him she wouldn’t be taking the stand. Adam Reiss is a reporter and producer for NBC and MSNBC.

190,Politics,"Fifty-six scanning systems that can detect fentanyl in personal vehicles at southern U.S. border crossings will now be installed because of $200 million in new funding that was approved by Congress after   the scanners were sitting unused in warehouses. Ninety-five percent of the fentanyl U.S. law enforcement seizes is discovered in personal vehicles driven across the border by U.S. citizens, according to Department of Homeland Security officials, and the scanners are the strongest tool the Biden administration has to detect fentanyl in vehicles. After the NBC News report,  ,   and two   called for additional funding to install the scanners that had been previously requested by DHS. Funding to finally install the machines came through the House Homeland Security appropriations bill,  . The 56 that will be installed because of the new funding will be in place by 2026, according to a senior Customs and Border Protection official. Thirty-one scanning systems are already in place, and 27 are under construction. All of the scanners were appropriated in 2021. DHS says that once the scanners are in place, 40% of all personal vehicles crossing the border will be scanned. Now, fewer than 5% of personal vehicles are X-rayed, according to DHS officials.  At ports of entry without scanners, customs officers have to rely on their own intuition to detect something amiss and hold vehicles for further inspection. Since 2021, the U.S. government has struggled to install fentanyl scanners at ports of entry. Critics have applauded the progress but say it’s still just a drop in the bucket. Bobby Watt was at CBP for over 30 years and oversaw non-intrusive inspection scanning at ports of entry before he left CBP in 2019; he blames red tape for the delays. He says the goal should be to scan 100% of personal vehicles. “It’d be foolish not to,” said Watt, now an adviser to scanning contractor Viken Detection. “Because if you were a drug smuggler, would you go to a port that had an X-ray? Or would you go to the one next to it that didn’t have an X-ray?”  DHS has pointed to construction challenges with installation, such as a lack of room at ports of entry to install the systems, and says it doesn’t have the funding from Congress needed to scan 100% of vehicles. The senior CBP official said the 40% of vehicles that will be scanned won’t be randomly chosen; instead, they’ll be vehicles determined to pose the highest risk. New congressional funding to reach 40% of the vehicles was hailed by some parents who have lost children to fentanyl, like Cindy DeMaio, who lost her daughter in Ohio to fentanyl poisoning in 2016. DeMaio works with parents around the country to educate others about fentanyl, including putting up billboards along the southern border where fentanyl is being driven across. “Anything we can do to increase the catching of these people and decrease the negative impacts on our country is extremely powerful,” she said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has criticized the slow efforts to install the scanners. In the fall he called for the Government Accountability Office to examine how DHS has spent more than a billion dollars on the X-ray equipment. The inquiry is underway, a GAO spokesperson said, and a report will be completed this year. Cornyn and Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., want any new scanners to be tested to ensure that any technology purchased in the future is the most effective. They introduced a   this year to evaluate five kinds of scanners to ensure they catch the most fentanyl.  “Last year, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl at the southern border to kill every American 16 times over, and we have no way of knowing how much more evaded law enforcement,” Cornyn said. “This legislation would help address glaring problems in the fentanyl detection system by requiring CBP to test new pieces of detection technology at land ports of entry so we can prevent this deadly drug from claiming more lives.” In a statement, a CBP spokesperson said, ""CBP has repeatedly sought funding for the installation of NII [scanner] technology — including the civil works funding needed to install existing systems, which was requested in the supplemental funding request in October 2023 and partially funded by the recent appropriation."" ""Non-intrusive inspection technology is one tool in in CBP’s multi-layered approach to interdicting fentanyl and contraband,"" said the spokesperson.

191,Politics,"HIALEAH, Fla. — Some Florida groups that support abortion rights are concerned that a ballot measure to and invalidate the recently enacted six-week abortion ban may not pass in November if more donor money is not pumped into these organizations to raise awareness and turn out voters. “This bill passing is not a slam-dunk deal by any means,” said Alex Berrios, co-founder of the progressive group Mi Vecino, which is focused on voter education and mobilization. “While there is overall support for the ballot measure, there is not nearly enough without persuading undecided voters.” Florida   after six weeks of gestation — before many women know they're pregnant —  to adapt  Until the ban went into effect,   in the Southeast where abortion was still largely accessible. Now the closest state with abortion access beyond six weeks is North Carolina, where it is allowed until 12 weeks. The proposed amendment would invalidate the six-week ban by barring restrictions on abortion before fetal viability, considered to be at about the 24th week of pregnancy. It would also include exceptions past that point for “the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” Since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade,  voters have favored expanding abortion rights in all the states that introduced abortion-related ballot measures.  But in Florida, amendments need 60% or more approval to pass — a high threshold that worries activists here.  In swing states like   and  , voters have backed abortion rights at the ballot by less than 57%. Berrios and other activists point out that Florida, a larger state with double the population size, requires more volunteers and resources to educate voters about ballot measures and convince them to turn out to vote.  The state has also tilted right in recent years and is no longer considered a swing state, making it more difficult to convince voters who see this as a partisan and not a health-care issue, some activists say. Andrea Mercado, executive director of Florida Rising, a progressive voting rights group, said she has seen an increase in foundation and donor funds to the state's nonprofit groups after the ballot initiative was approved, but “the budget isn’t fully raised by any stretch of the imagination yet,” she said. “Florida is the third largest state in the nation, so to reach our population and to win 60% of the vote is going to require all hands on deck,” Mercado said. “And it will be expensive to make sure that 60% of voters in November vote yes on Amendment 4.” Mi Vecino, a group based in West Palm Beach with offices in Central Florida, usually focuses on Latino voters, but it has been reaching out to all voter groups in Central Florida, knocking on doors since December.  Berrios, the co-founder, said they would be canvassing in South Florida right now but lack the funds to take on the task. So far, they have knocked on about 77,000 doors to talk about the ballot measure and made a quarter-million phone calls to voters in Central and South Florida. “What we found consistently is that voters are very open to supporting this initiative,” said Berrios. “But there’s a lot of work that has to be done around it. Voters are not necessarily motivated to support it.” Among Florida Democrats they've reached out to, about 20% said they were against the amendment, while 13% were undecided — that's almost a third of Democrats who are not presently saying they support the measure. Among Republicans they spoke with, 28% say they support Amendment 4 while 25% are undecided — that's almost half of Republicans that could potentially support the measure, according to Berrios. This shows that for Amendment 4 to get 60% of the vote, the support has to cut across Democrats, Republicans and independents, he said.     Days after Florida’s six-week abortion ban went into effect, Gina Romero, an organizer with Florida Rising, a progressive voting rights group, began canvassing in Hialeah, a working-class city in Miami Dade County that is 95% Latino. A majority voted for Trump in 2020. Armed with flyers and a hat to shield the punishing sun, Romero knocked on doors and spoke to voters where about half seemed to support the measure and the other half did not. Many people weren’t home and Romero left a flyer at their door with information. “We are Catholic. We don’t believe in abortion,” said Maria Luisa Benitez, a retired agricultural engineer, as she discussed Amendment 4 with Romero at her doorstep, her dogs barking in the background. Benitez did agree there should be certain exceptions to abortion restrictions when a woman's health is endangered.  Down the block, Doris Saldá, 68, said she supports Amendment 4 and called the abortion ban “an attack on my body.” “I pay taxes and I’m law abiding. I should have the freedom to do what I want with my body,” said Saldá.Nationally, Democrats are seizing on abortion, hoping it will galvanize moderate voters, especially women, to turn out in November.  The Biden campaign often cites Democratic victories in the 2022 midterm election as examples of the issue driving voters to turn out. After Florida’s Supreme Court approved the state's six-week abortion ban, President  Joe Biden made a  , where he blamed Donald Trump for ""this nightmare"" — Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three conservative Supreme Court justices who ruled in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade.  Biden read off a list of states where voters have supported abortion rights measures and said, “This November, you can add Florida to that list.” On the day the six-week ban went into effect, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a  , calling the measure “another Trump abortion ban.” But now that the pivotal swing state has moved further to the right in recent years, some abortion rights advocates stress the importance of seeing abortion access as a health care issue and not a Democratic issue to ensure support across all voters.    Lauren Brenzel, the campaign director of ""Yes on 4,"" which advocates for the amendment, said Floridians are used to the 60% threshold and noted that other ballot measures, like the one on the 2020 ballot to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, passed with 60% of the vote. “Floridians understand that policy can exist outside of the candidate space,” Brenzel said. “That is so important for abortion, because, unfortunately, what we see is political actors on both sides who have really taken this issue and made it a political one, when normal people think this is a health care issue.”   Berrios said that in a state like Florida, ""it’s going to come down to who delivers the most effective message, and then turns out their support. ...

195,Sports,"Diego Maradona’s Golden Ball trophy from the 1986 World Cup has resurfaced. The award, which had been missing for decades, will be auctioned in Paris next month, the Aguttes house said Tuesday. Maradona,   at age 60, was awarded the trophy for his scintillating play at the tournament, where he captained Argentina in its 3-2 win over West Germany in the final in Mexico City. Before that, he scored the controversial “Hand of God” goal and the “Goal of the Century” in a 2-1 win over England in the quarterfinals. The auction house said it expects the trophy “to fetch millions due to its uniqueness.” Maradona received the award — given to the tournament’s best player — at a ceremony at the Lido cabaret on the Champs-Élysées in 1986. It subsequently disappeared, giving rise to rumors. Some say it was lost during a wild poker game, or sold to pay off debts, Aguttes said. Others said Maradona had stored it in a safe in a Naples bank that was robbed by local gangsters in 1989, when he played in the Italian league. According to the story told by a reformed member of the mafia, the trophy was then melted down into gold pieces. “A far-fetched theory, given that it was made of a gold-copper alloy,” Aguttes said in its auction catalogue. Aguttes said the trophy reappeared in 2016 among other lots that were acquired from a private collection at auction in Paris. “It was thoroughly investigated and authenticated as Diego Maradona’s Adidas Golden Ball trophy,” Aguttes said. The “Hand of God” goal came when Maradona punched the ball into England’s net for his team’s opener. Maradona was also a magician with the ball at his feet and four minutes later, he weaved through England’s midfield and defense and then past goalkeeper Peter Shilton for what FIFA later declared the greatest goal in World Cup history. “To say that this World Cup had it all would be an understatement ... it was also, and above all, the tournament where Diego Maradona really showed the world what he could do with his feet, and even with his hands,” said François Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes.

196,Sports,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A Malaysian international footballer has been splashed by acid and two other top players were attacked within a week by unknown assailants, in a rare outbreak of violence targeting athletes in the country. Police criminal investigation chief Mohamad Shuhaily Mohamad Zain said Wednesday that there were similarities in the three attacks and that the victims appeared to have been targeted. But investigators have not determined whether the cases were linked. Faisal Halim, who plays as a winger for the national team and Malaysian club Selangor, was hospitalized with fourth-degree burns following an acid attack by two assailants at a shopping mall on Sunday. He was reported to be in critical but stable condition, with limited movement and speech. Just three days earlier, another prominent national team player, Akhyar Rashid, was assaulted in a robbery outside his house in eastern Terengganu state after his return from training. He was hit with an iron rod, leaving him head and leg injuries. His attackers fled after taking money from him. Late Tuesday, former national team captain Safiq Rahim was tailed by two assailants on a motorbike after a training session in southern Johor state. They later threatened him with a hammer and smashed his car’s rear window but he was not physically hurt. “Our investigations also showed that the players involved were tailed prior to the attacks. The perpetrators also worked in pairs in all the attacks,” Shuhaily, the investigation chief, was quoted as saying by English-language daily The Star. Two people were initially detained over Faisal’s attack, but one was later released. Shuhaily said police were studying the possibility that the attacks could be linked to a recent letter sent to the Malaysian soccer federation (FAM) accusing it of mismanagement of funds, bribery and fraud. However, the country’s anti-graft agency has found those accusations baseless. Police urged professional footballers to be vigilant while the investigation is ongoing, while FAM has suggested that star players consider hiring bodyguards.

198,Sports,"A northern Idaho prosecutor won’t bring hate crime charges against an 18-year-old accused of during the NCAA Tournament. The deputy attorney for the city of Coeur d’Alene made the announcement on Monday, writing in a charging decision document that though the use of the slur was “detestable” and “incredibly offensive,” there wasn’t evidence suggesting that the man was threatening physical harm to the women or to their property. That means the conduct is protected by the First Amendment and can’t be charged under Idaho’s malicious harassment law, Ryan Hunter wrote. The members of the University of Utah basketball team were staying at a Coeur d’Alene hotel in March as they competed at the NCAA Tournament in nearby Spokane, Washington. Team members were walking from a hotel to a restaurant when they said a truck drove up and the driver yelled a racist slur at the group. After the team left the restaurant, the same driver returned and was “reinforced by others,” revving their engines and yelling again at the players, said Tony Stewart, an official with the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, during a news conference shortly after the event. The encounters were so disturbing that they left the group concerned about their safety, Utah coach Lynne Roberts said a few days later. Far-right extremists have maintained a presence in the region for years. In 2018, at least nine hate groups operated in the region of Spokane and northern Idaho, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. “We had several instances of some kind of racial hate crimes toward our program and (it was) incredibly upsetting for all of us,” Roberts said. “In our world, in athletics and in university settings, it’s shocking. There’s so much diversity on a college campus and so you’re just not exposed to that very often.” University of Utah officials declined to comment about the prosecutor’s decision on Wednesday. In the document detailing the decision, Hunter said police interviewed nearly two dozen witnesses and pored over hours of surveillance video. Several credible witnesses described a racist slur being hurled at the group as they walked to dinner, but their descriptions of the vehicle and the person who shouted the slur varied, and police weren’t able to hear any audio of the yelling on the surveillance tapes. There also wasn’t any evidence to connect the encounter before the team arrived at the restaurant with what happened as they left, Hunter, wrote. Still, police were able to identify the occupants of a silver passenger vehicle involved in the second encounter, and one of them — an 18-year-old high school student — reportedly confessed to shouting a slur and an obscene statement at the group, Hunter said. Prosecutors considered whether to bring three possible charges against the man — malicious harassment, disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace — but decided they didn’t have enough evidence to support any of the three charges. That’s because Idaho’s hate crime law only makes racial harassment a crime if it is done with the intent to either threaten or cause physical harm to a person or to their property. The man who shouted the slur told police he did it because he thought it would be funny, Hunter wrote. “Setting aside the rank absurdity of that claim and the abjectly disgusting thought process required to believe it would be humorous to say something that abhorrent,” it undermines the premise that the man had the specific intent to intimidate and harass, Hunter wrote. The hateful speech also didn’t meet the requirements of Idaho’s disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace laws, which are mainly about when and where noise or unruly behavior occurs. The slurs were shouted on a busy thoroughfare during the early evening hours, and so the noise level wasn’t unusual for that time and place. Hunter wrote that his office shares in the outrage sparked by the man’s “abhorrently racist and misogynistic statement, and we join in unequivocally condemning that statement and the use of a racial slur in this case, or in any circumstance. However that cannot, under current law, form the basis for criminal prosecution in this case.” The Associated Press",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/no-hate-crime-charges-filed-man-yelled-racist-slurs-utah-womens-basket-rcna151332,NBC,No hate crime charges filed against man who yelled racist slurs at Utah women’s basketball team,,1
199,Sports,"WNBA star and Olympian Brittney Griner writes that she felt she was being used as a “pawn” by Russian President Vladimir Putin when she was arrested and imprisoned just weeks before he invaded Ukraine in 2022. The Phoenix Mercury star’s memoir “Coming Home,” which debuted Tuesday at No. 1 on Amazon’s best-sellers list, lays out in detail the events leading up to her arrest, the challenges of her nearly 10-month detainment in some of Russia’s most notorious penal colonies, the agony of waiting to be released — and so much more, all in 300 pages. In one section, she describes the experience of being a Black gay woman in a Russian prison under Putin.  “Black lives matter,” Griner wrote. “We hear that in the streets, but what is a Black life really worth? Judging by our history, it seems not much, and even less if you’re gay. For Putin, my worth was as a pawn. My arrest gave him leverage in his clash with the West. He was well aware of America’s long history of racial tensions, and he knew how to use that to his benefit.” In February 2022, Griner traveled to Russia to play her eighth season in the country’s women’s basketball league. She was arrested after two vials of cannabis oil, totaling less than a gram, were found in her luggage at the airport in Moscow. She pleaded guilty to drug charges and was   to nine years in prison.  Griner wrote that she was distressed about having disappointed her closely knit family and Black people in general.  When the news of her arrest broke, Griner wrote: “I cried because I’d let down my father. The Griner name was now stained around the globe: dopehead, drug dealer, dumb. I hurt because I knew I’d handed the world a weapon. When you’re Black, your behavior is never just about you. It’s about your entire community.”  Though she said she wears her Blackness with pride, Griner said she felt as though her actions “shamed my people.” “Blackness doesn’t make you less, but it does frame your life,” she wrote. “When you walk into a room, so does race. Frankly, it shows up before you do. It colors every conversation, shapes how you’re viewed, determines whether you’re even heard. From the day you get here, Blackness hangs over everything, from comments about your hair (‘Can I touch it?’) to mentions that certain Black people are ‘smart’ (’cause it’s assumed we’re idiots). The message comes through loud and clear: You’re not one of us, you’re less.” It was so bad that Griner  in the early days of incarceration. She wrote that she’d spend her nights “listing ways I could end my misery.” She thought better of it. And after many sleepless nights, she stopped caring about the freezing temperatures, that her long legs dangled off the mattress and that the bed springs poked into her body. “I was a legit zombie,” she said.   By the time Griner was allowed to shower there, she was shocked at the repulsive conditions, but knew she had to get in the water.  “In the WNBA, my teammates and I joked about the prison showers — a big space with spouts spread around. This was the real thing,” she wrote. “It was nasty, exposed pipes on every wall. Long hair strands all over the tile floor and gathered in the drains. A bloody tampon was tucked between two pipes. As much as I was disgusted by the scene, I was just as repulsed by my stench.” Correctional Colony No. 1, also known as IK-1, is a former orphanage converted into a prison about 50 miles from Moscow, which would take about two hours to drive in Russia’s notorious traffic. Griner had spent the time being transported there handcuffed, with her 6-foot-9 frame folded in the back of a vehicle not equipped for someone her height. She was also deeply afraid, not knowing what to expect, but knowing that where she was headed was no place anyone would want to be. When there, she received myriad instructions before making it to the shower.  “I undressed and found the cleanest part of the floor,” she wrote. “I turned the faucet on, and rusty brown water came spouting out.” Once she got over the color, “hot water felt so good on my skin. I closed my eyes tight, trying to forget where I was. I thought of Relle [her wife] and home and all I had left behind. Down the water slid from my dreads onto the floor splashing away the hell I endured. I stayed in there a good 30 minutes until I banged on the door for the guard to let me out. That was the nastiest shower I’d ever taken. It was also the best.” She wrote about her increased fear when transferred to an even more notorious labor camp, Correctional Colony No. 2 or IK-2, 300 miles east of Moscow.

200,Sports,"Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player on Wednesday.  Jokic, who also took home the honor in 2021 and 2022, is just the ninth player in league history to claim three MVP awards. The only others since 1990: Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  The Serbian big man averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9 assists a game this season while shooting 58.3% from the field.  Jokic, 29, got 79 first-place votes, while fellow finalists Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks got 15 and four, respectively.  Jokic is one of the most unusual players ever to compete in the NBA. At 6-foot-11 and 284 pounds, he has the size, length and strength to back opponents down in the post but also a soft shooting touch to hit from midrange and outside the arc. He also has exceptional ball-handling and passing ability for a center, making him the quintessential modern big man. He finished the 2023-24 season fifth in total points, third in total rebounds, second in total assists and eighth in total steals. Jokic is the only player in NBA history to rank in the top 10 in all four categories in a single season since the league began keeping statistics on steals in 1973-74.  The Nuggets — the defending NBA champions — finished the regular season second in the Western Conference behind the Thunder. Denver is down 0-2 in its postseason series with the Minnesota Timberwolves.  “There are a lot of players that deserve it,” Jokic said on TNT after the announcement. “It’s probably the details and small things … but we lost two games at home to Minnesota. Tomorrow we leave to [go to] Minnesota to try to get the series back to Denver.” Shaquille O’Neal said on the broadcast that Gilgeous-Alexander deserved the honor. He averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 assists and 5.5 rebounds while leading Oklahoma City to the best record in the conference.  “I don’t like to rain on people’s parades, but I’m not happy with this one. ... I felt Shai Gilgeous-Alexander deserved it,” he said. “I know this is going to be hurtful for him. Hopefully he uses this to motivate him to win a championship.” Greg Rosenstein is the sports editor for NBC News Digital.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/nuggets-star-nikola-jokic-wins-2024-nba-mvp-award-third-last-four-seas-rcna151385,NBC,"Nuggets star Nikola Jokic wins 2024 NBA MVP award, his third in the last four seasons",,1
201,Sports,"INDIANAPOLIS — Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they’ve opened an investigation into an “NBA player and citizen” altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Bucks guard  in the final minutes of   to the Pacers. Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives, “who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.” Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office at the conclusion of the investigation, the release stated. Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands, hitting a fan in the head with about 2 ½ minutes left in the game on May 2. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator. Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of “The Pat Bev Podcast” that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he’d never been called before, but added that his own actions were “still inexcusable.” “I will be better,” he said. “I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened. Simple as that.” Beverley added the atmosphere in Indiana “was great” aside from “a handful of fans” who crossed the line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98, eliminating Milwaukee from the playoffs. “I ain’t bringing a basketball on the bench no more,” Beverley said. “That … threw my whole vibe off.” After the game, Beverley wouldn’t allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn’t subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face and then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle. On his podcast Wednesday, Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that “it was never my intent to disrespect you.” A day after the loss, Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley’s behavior was “not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.” “We’re better than that,” Rivers said. “Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally — this is an emotional game and things happen — unfortunately, you’re judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/milwaukee-bucks-patrick-beverley-police-investigating-rcna151400,NBC,Police investigating after Milwaukee Bucks player Patrick Beverley threw ball at fan,,1

Mizuhara was an employee of Ohtani's former team, the Los Angeles Angels, but Ohtani ""paid him separately for the additional work of driving him to meetings and interpreting for non-baseball-related activities,"" prosecutors said.
