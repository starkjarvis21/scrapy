President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

“The Zimbabwean workers are victims of these illegal sanctions and today we want to give them solidarity. Our message to all the oppressed people and the workers in the world is we salute you.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/workers-efforts-hailed/,The Herald,Workers’ efforts hailed

Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has exposed 11 cases of fake doctors this year alone, as people take advantage of the vastness of the country’s largest referral medical institution to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

He has since appeared in court.",https://www.herald.co.zw/pari-exposes-11-fake-doctors-in-4-months/,The Herald,Pari exposes 11 fake doctors in 4 months

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

“I don’t want to appear like we want to reverse the brain drain, but let those who train in Zambia remain in Zambia and those we train remain here.",https://www.herald.co.zw/health-workforce-to-double-by-2028/,The Herald,

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and business organisations will be held during the business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

The late national hero and leader of the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa (ZAOGA), Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, was a visionary leader who valued the empowerment of children through education, Information and Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingimuzi Phuti said this week.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Ezekiel Guti Christian Primary School in Riverside, Chitungwiza, after touring the school as part of preparations for the Ezekiel Guti Day to be commemorated on Saturday, he said: “I am humbled by the vision of our departed hero, Baba Guti, the vision that put the concerns of a human being to reality, the vision that foresaw things that we are beginning to discover today, the importance of taking a child to school, the knowledge that it doesn’t have to be the responsibility of Government alone.

“It’s the responsibility that is more entangled with care and understanding the reason to empower somebody through education that drove him. But apart from that we are really touched by the ahead of time kind of man he was,” he said.

Deputy Minister Phuti said the programme was meant to celebrate the life of an illustrious son of Zimbabwe whose visionary leadership was noticeable not only in Zimbabwe alone but impacted lives around the world.

The ministry has partnered the Ezekiel Guti Primary School to train youths in the use of ICT.

“In honour of the legacy of Baba Guti we decided that we come in with our digital relevance hence that training we have organised in partnership with your administration.

“We hope that the training will not only open up the eyes of our youngsters but will motivate them to pursue other relevant skills from this,” he said.

Archbishop Guti’s widow, Apostle Eunor Guti expressed her gratitude to the Ministry for the partnership.

“I would like to thank the Ministry of ICT for partnering with us and joining the Zaoga family as we celebrate the life and legacy of our father, Professor Guti,” she said.

Entertainment,"May Day may be a fairly quiet holiday but it is a very important one as it concentrates minds on the position of workers within the economy and the need to ensure that their contribution is recognised.

Their rights and expectations are also taken into account.

President Mnangagwa set the tone with his statement on the eve of the public holiday, that the workers are an essential part of the economic growth through their production and productivity, and their importance cannot be minimised. Without the workers there is no production and they are entitled to their fair share of the wealth their efforts produce.

The Government is the largest employer, and runs almost all the essential services that the rest of us need to produce and to work, so as Head of Government he renewed his commitment that conditions of service will be continually improved within the State sector.

There are obvious limits to just how fast remuneration can be raised and the non-monetary benefits can be implemented and increased. We are not going to print money, or even borrow money, to pay civil servants more since that just leads to economic challenges.

But as the economy grows the tax revenue grows and so more can be done each year to improve the conditions of State workers. The Government, within its fiscal discipline that is now so essential, has maintained the percentage of revenue spent on staff, and maintained it as the largest item in the budget, so economic growth automatically means more can be spent.

The commitment by the President not to take State workers for granted and to maintain the policy of continual improvement as the economy grows is, therefore, important. He recognises their essential input and he wants to treat them fairly.

The President also made his appeal to the private sector, which employs considerably more people than the State, even with the growth of self-employment, to again follow a similar policy of continual improvement and making sure that workers are treated fairly and get their fair share of the wealth being created. Again this is the result of a growing economy, growing production and growing investment.

A major plank of President Mnangagwa’s policy is the Vision 2030, pushing Zimbabwe upwards into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. That is not just a mantra, since we have to think about what that journey means.

The only way to have a successful and continuous increase in national wealth is to make sure that everyone benefits.

That in turn increases growth. Even the arch-capitalist Henry Ford grabbed that point early on as he introduced mass production of motor cars. He worked out that he was not going to succeed unless his own very large workforce could afford to buy the cars they made, so he raised wages and was able to pay these through the higher productivity his assembly lines generated as well as the growing stream of revenue from his growing sales. Everything worked together.

The growing number of the self-employed win as well when employers are fair. Those civil servants and private-sector workers spend the money they earn, and spend quite a lot of it on the goods and services that the self-employed provide. So they win and the whole nation together moves forward. In any case, the small businesses become larger and start hiring people, so they need to remember that they must pay their new workers their just dues.

The Government follows this policy by using the small-scale farming sectors to drive rural development. The whole policy is based on the premise that converting subsistence farmers into small commercial farmers creates the wealth that drives rural industrialisation and the growing percentage of rural dwellers who provide the goods and services that the farmers require and want.

In a developed economy a huge majority of rural dwellers are not farmers, but the underlying rural economy is based on farm production, so the Second Republic rural development policy is based on fact and functional theory, not on some pipedream. Vision 2030 is based on the need for the people, as well as the national economy, to be upper middle income.

While the Second Republic has streamlined labour law, to make it easier to understand and implement, it has retained the essential core that workers and employees are human beings who have rights, as well as duties, and has retained the whole gamut of the national employment councils and workers committees that have been so effective in ensuring that employers and employees can negotiate properly and equally. It has strengthened the similar system in State service, so there is a joint negotiating forum.

The national employment councils were created in settler days to benefit the white workers. They were partially extended under the more liberal settler regime of the late 1950s to more of the formal sector, but only started flourishing fully after independence when everyone was included fully in spirit as well as law.

But they need to be used. Some sectors have very strong and effective NECs and not only do employees benefit, but employers have found that they also benefit by having agreements that work and so can be factored into operations. So they make sure that proper and accurate data is available and enforce the NEC decisions.

Some sectors have very weak NECs, the commercial workers especially, and both employers and employees need to upgrade these.  Sometimes past splits give rise to the oddity that workers in the same sector, and even under the same employer, fall under different NECs. Combining them so that the strongest and best represents all workers in a sector makes sense, for both sides.

Labour law is there to create the practical conditions that President Mnangagwa spoke so strongly about, the need for employers and employees to be fair, and for workers to receive their just share of the growing wealth and basically to ensure that workers who fulfil their duties conscientiously are not treated as cogs in a machine but as co-creators of that extra wealth.",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-drivers-of-the-economy-need-recognition-fair-remuneration/,The Herald,

The stage is set for the launch of the award-winning interdenominational choir, ZimPraise Legacy’s Season 16, dubbed “The Love Project”, this Saturday night.

Themed “Under the Stars”, the live album launch will be held at Harare Gardens and will see a star-studded line-up of artistes sharing the stage with the choir.

The line-up includes Pastor G, Everton Mlalazi, Kuda Mutsvene, Dorcas Moyo, Jonah Chivasa, Benjamin Rupapa and The Unveiled.

In February they had a listener’s session with some of their fans including business personalities and celebrities, who had a chance to sample the album before its launch, before the choir then went back and perfected the album.

“ZimPraise Season 16”, which is part of the 21 albums, will see the choir sampling the songs live on stage, including some of their collaborations.

In an interview, the choir’s founder member, Joseph Madziyire, said this is a busy season for them.

“We recorded the album in Nyanga and Vumba and I am happy all went well. Now we are launching the album and expect some fireworks,”   he said.

Madziyire said they titled the album “The Love Project – Season 16” because it was first pre-launched in the month of love, Jand the songs are dedicated to the love of Jesus.

He clarified that it is not the 16th album but Season 16.

“Well, we have 21 albums, including ‘Hymnal Night’. Some of the songs to listen to on Season 16, include ‘Dai Mapindira’, ‘Hallelujah’, ‘Musanditendera’, ‘Ufanelwe’, ‘Murudo’ and ‘Mukuru Wevakuru’ among  others.

“We are going to play them at Harare Gardens and we will also share some of the videos with the fans.

“I am happy with how corporates have jumped on board, supporting and endorsing Season 16. It would be myopic not to thank Nyaradzo (Phillip Mataranyika) and my business brothers and sisters,” he said.

Madziyire said some of the songs on Season 16 have shown that the album has strong influence from Afro-fusion, sungura and contemporary music. Along with the six-track list, Madziyire released the credits for the artistes, composers, co-producers and song-writers with whom he collaborated.

They include the likes of Everton Mlalazi, Tino Dambaneuga, Shammah Phiri, Spirit Fingers and Emmanuel Chiwangwa.

Interesting to note is that the addition of iconic groups like ZCC Mbungo may show that it will also be a vibe and dance “Season” compared to others.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zimpraises-the-love-project-season-16-unveiling-date-set/,The Herald,ZimPraise’s ‘The Love Project’ Season 16 unveiling date set

Afro-fusion-jazz artiste Agga Nyabinde’s album launch at 7 Arts Theatre in Harare last week was a success as he thrilled the crowd, keeping them on their feet with every    chorus.

The crowd could not help but be drawn in as the sound quality was excellent.

This was his first album since the death of his father, “The Headmaster”, and he did not disappoint his fans.

The 11-track album, titled “Honai”, has three tracks dedicated to his late father, Bob Nyabinde, and the musician said it is of sentimental value as it is the very first album he is doing without his father.

He wowed the crowd with “Chabuda Hapana” and the fans sang along perfectly.

Fellow artistes  who graced the launch praised Agga for a well-polished  album.

“I am grateful to be part of this event, it is such a great honour. What my brother did tonight was amazing. I am proud of him,” said Taffie Matiure.

Also on stage was musician Dereck Mpofu, who put up a spectacular act as he dished out “Mari (Unonaka Iwe)” and “Ndinokakama”, keeping the crowd on their feet on the dance floor.

“It is always a happy and joyous occasion when we come together to support one of our own. What Agga did tonight cannot be explained. Everything was on point and it’s quite amazing how the crowd responded. Well done bro!”

Other artistes featured on the album include Selmor Mtukudzi and  Mbeu.

Selmor gave a spirited performance as she joined Agga on stage for their song “Kufara kweumwe”.

Cool crooner Victor Kunonga (Nduna) also joined Agga on stage for a performance of their song “Kutumira”.

Wrapping up the launch Agga acknowledged fellow artistes and fans for making the show a success.

“The turn-out was amazing and I would love to thank fellow artistes and fans who came in their numbers. The support I got from fellow musicians is amazing.

“I would also like to extend my sincerest gratitude to partners and stakeholders who made this possible,” said Agga.

He also promised to release videos of each of his songs from the album every month.

Other artistes who performed were Vazukuru veAfrica, Matiure, Tariro Negitare and Mwenje Mathole.

Fans also saluted Agga for the album launch.

An excited fan, Chioniso Mpofu, said; “This is a top drawer performance, I had value for my money. The sound was amazing and the performances were top-notch. I am happy for Agga,” as she drove off reminiscing and singing to one of Agga’s songs.

Another fan, Wealth Masendu, said Agga was following his father’s   footsteps.

“I enjoyed his new songs. He is following in his father’s footsteps, which is good because his father’s legacy continues. If he carries on like this, he will get to his father’s level or even surpass it,” he said.

Jayne Matambanashe, also a fan, said his album showcased Agga’s dedication to the music industry.

“This was a well-written piece of work with a lot of handiwork on it, which shows that he is committed to his music career.

“I would also want to applaud him for working with his brother Albert, and they should continue doing so. Their songs have a real-life meaning and resonate with everyday situations,” she  said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/aggas-album-launch-lives-up-to-billing/,The Herald,Agga’s album launch lives up to billing

Desmond Chikamhi, a Mandela Washington fellow and development practitioner, is set to launch his first book titled “Yes You Can” on Friday at Cresta Jameson Hotel in Harare from 5pm to 9pm.

The World Life Changers founder and executive director, who has been involved in community development since 2018, said the book is designed to open readers’ minds to a world of possibilities in spite of their circumstances.

“The book carries some invaluable wisdom nuggets for a victorious life and my hope is that it will unleash a culture of excellence and productivity amongst our people.

“It is a landmark motivational publication designed to equip and empower readers to chase their dreams and bring them to fruition.

“It is an antidote to the lethargy, demotivation and fear,” Chikamhi said.

The Zaka-born community builder, who grew up under challenging circumstances, said the wisdom in the book is derived from his difficult personal experiences.

“The goal is to demonstrate that impossibilities only exist in our minds. Once we reconfigure our minds to operate in a positive way, nothing is impossible. Life is there for the taking for anyone who can dash and grab it with both hands.

“The book launch is, therefore, going to be a life celebration as we share ideas and life nuggets on how to get ahead and stay ahead. Its all about daring each other not only to dream, but to also see our dreams materialising,” Chikamhi said.

The event is set to be curated by creative agency Esteem Communications while various influencers, corporate leaders and creatives are expected to attend the event.

“We have enlisted the services of Esteem Communications to help us curate the launch and all is in place for an uplifting life experience.

Chikamhi, who has implemented a number of life changing community development projects around Zimbabwe, said working with vulnerable communities to change their lives was the biggest inspiration behind the book.

“Working with communities and getting to change their lives through our organisation was the biggest inspiration behind this book. My eyes were opened to possibilities and I want fellow Zimbabweans and readers across the world to see things the same way.

During Cyclone Idai, we assisted over 10 000 families in Chimanimani under one of our Disaster and Relief Programmes, where we respond to natural disasters that befall our vulnerable communities. We donated non-food items like crutches, wheelchairs, blankets and clothes worth thousands, with support from United Methodist Church in the United Kingdom,” Chikamhi said.

The Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA) has appointed Fungai Zvirawa as the new chief executive officer.

Zvirawa who is affectionately known as “Kush”, took over from Reason Sibanda who steered the music related body for the past five years.

ZIMA chairperson Joseph Nyadzayo said Zvirawa has vast experience, having worked with internationally acclaimed artistes.

“The Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA) is thrilled to announce the appointment of Fungai Zvirawa as its new Chief Executive Officer. Fungai has a robust background spanning over a decade in the music industry. Ms Zvirawa brings with her a wealth of experience in artiste management, event organisation and the creation of innovative campaigns that seamlessly blend the creative and corporate realms,” said Nyadzayo.

“Kush has vast experience; she came in as an internationally accredited figure having worked with great people in the industry. Coming in from the United Kingdom, she will actually make  ZIMA attain global accolades,” he said.

Nyadzayo said Kush came to deliver and to prop up the music awards body to higher levels.

“We know Kush is a deliverer and a hard worker, we had a run with her during the last edition. She was part of the team to familiarise her with the system. To appoint her, we are actually sure that she has what it takes to head ZIMA. Kush has other successes in advertising, even in the music industry” said Nyadzayo.

In her acceptance speech Kush promised to deliver and to upscale the status of musicians with the locals being the first port of call.

“I’m very excited with the new appointment that I now have, my vision is to give the music awards a new dimension and to continue enhancing and adding value to Zimbabwe Music Awards.”

“I started the journey last year as an executive director. I will continue to connect Zimbabwe with the rest of the world,” said Kush.

Kush said the ZIMA awards ceremony will be announced in a fortnight.

“In a couple of weeks, we will announce the roadmap of music awards,” she said.

The outgoing CEO Sibanda pledged to render support to his successor, adding he was sure about her credentials.

“I’m glad that we have considered a culture of allowing new ideas to come in to take ZIMA to the next level. I will render a lot of support to Kush and I have much confidence in her,” said Sibanda.

“I organised virtual awards during the Covid-19 era as an attempt to ensure continuity of our annual programmes. It was quite challenging to take a risk under such circumstances,” said Sibanda.

During his tenure, Sibanda facilitated the acquisition of proper accommodation for the late Chimurenga music guru Dick Chingaira, who was affectionately known as Cde Chinx Chingaira.

“The Hondo Yeminda” hit-maker made his music penetrate into the minds of young people born after the liberation struggle, through his songs which supported the Land Reform Programme. Cde Chinx was accorded liberation war hero status.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zima-appoints-new-head/,The Herald,ZIMA appoints new head

All is set for afro-fusion-jazz artist, Aggabu Nyabinde’s album launch tonight at the 7Arts Theatre in Avondale.

The album, titled ‘Honai’, is a testimony of his life and how he has grown in the music industry.

‘Honai’ has 11 tracks, with three songs dedicated to his late father, Bob ‘The Headmaster’ Nyabinde.

In an interview with Agga, he said the stage is set for the album launch, adding that he is happy with the endorsements and support he is getting from fellow artistes and fans.

“The day has finally come and I am happy that the album is ready. All roads lead to Avondale tonight, I chose to host the album launch this Tuesday because tomorrow is a holiday, therefore people will be relaxed. I encourage my fans to come and witness the launch of this grand album,” he said.

Agga said the three songs dedicated to his late father remind him of the time he spent with his father.

“This album is sentimental as it is the first time I am performing without my father, that’s why l have dedicated three songs to him. The songs are ‘Garai Neni’, ‘Samatenga’ and ‘Chisingaurayi’.

“Garai Neni’ is a popular hymn that reminds me of my father. He might be gone but he is not forgotten. He taught me all that I know. My brother Albert fronts this track.

“Samatenga’ is a rendition of the late great Simon Chimbetu. Sulumani Chimbetu gave me the nod to redo the song. No copyright infringements were made, I sat down with Mukoma Sulu and he gave me the green light. On that song, l featured a rising gospel musician, Denzel Malakai,” said Agga.

“Chisingaurayi’ was on my father’s list, unfortunately he was taken away too soon. I lovethis song. l would always jokingly ask him to sell it to me as I wanted to be a huge part of it. By doing this song, l am honouring his wish. He wanted me to sing the song someday,” he said.

“This is the first album I am doing without my father. To me, it is to say, “Baba, I made it. Look at your son,” he said.

Agga added that the album has various collaborations from different artistes, including Mbeu, Selmor Mtukudzi and Denzel Malakai.

“I did collaborations with different rising artists, including my band members, to also give them a chance to showcase their talent,” said the musician.

The title track ‘Honai’ is a collaboration with Mbeu done after a public plea for the due to work together.

Both of them were nurtured at Pakare Paye Arts Centre.

“I recorded my first album with Mono Mkundu and then took it to Dr Oliver Mtukudzi. He bluntly told me that it was a rushed project. It was a bitter pill for me to swallow but now I understand what he meant. Like fine wine, I have matured,” recounted Agga.

In 2020, Agga was nominated for the ZIMAs in the best traditional music category. The following year, he was nominated in the best Afro-jazz category. ln 2022, Aggathen scooped an award for the best Afro-jazz musician.

“This award is special to me because it is the same accolade my father won in 2004. Eighteen years later, I won it too,” said Agga.

Pieces of sculpture are there to effectively tell world stories in visuals, hence they are moralistic and didactic. 

Their influence must never be underrated and society at large does not stop casting eyes gazing at pieces of art, and deducing messages.

Award-winning sculptor Stanley Mutanga is designing and carving artefacts to encourage women to be screened early for breast cancer, which has become a new trajectory. 

Mutanga says he has been driven by the rate at which the disease is killing women. 

“I changed my imagination after realising that most women are dying as a result of cancer. My carvings are sending a message to the people, especially women and girls to go and get tested early for breast cancer at a stage where it is still controllable,” said Mutanga. 

Mutanga who is based in Tafara, returned home from Canada recently and was disheartened by stories of mothers losing their lives to breast cancer. 

“I want to ensure that the message is understood and is taken seriously, cancer is a dangerous disease that can be treated if screened early. The earlier breast cancer is detected, the better your chance of survival. 

“Early detection of breast cancer may mean less treatment and less time spent recovering. Most breast cancers are harmful and should be detected and treated as early as possible,” said Mutanga. Mutanga who was born in Murehwa and relocated to Harare in search of lucrative sculpting deals, highlights in some of his pieces, some of the measures that can reduce breast cancer. 

One of his pieces shows a mother breastfeeding her child as another way of reducing the chances of having the ailment.

“Breastfeeding can also lower a mother’s risk of breast and ovarian cancers. A recent study found that only about 1 in 4 people think that a woman is less likely to develop breast cancer later in life if she breastfeeds. 

It’s important to know that breastfeeding helps not only the baby’s health but also the mother’s health. In light of this I have some works that are depicting this,” he said. 

Tafara and Mabvuku have become a hive of sculpture activities with seasoned and those who are still under tutelage. 

Mutanga said he had nurtured at least 20 students who are making headways to occupy the arts space. Mutanga won a National Arts Merit Award (NAMA) and in 2019 was awarded for being the best 3 Dimension (3D) artist. 

He said when doing his work, he depicts everyday issues and occurrences. 

“Last summer I was invited to Gunguwo Art Farm in Canada. Some of my works are displayed in workshops in Kingston Canada. 

The sculpture which was voted the best that year is titled “Tribute to Mother of all Generations” When doing my work, I convey messages about things that I see every day. I also depict some everyday occurrences that affect people’s lives which include romance, culture, and nature as well. My current works are Under My Wing, Sweet Mother, and Mother Of Generations,” he said. 

 Mutanga said, apart from visiting his studio in Tafara, fans can also find his work on his Facebook page under S.Mutanga Sculptures, and on Instagram@wembizi as well as on his X account at Tweeter@stanley_mutanga.

He said it is important to embrace the arts industry by building more centres to make it more accessible. 

“I spent over thirty years in the arts. I think there is a need to build more art centres and embrace them through organising workshops to teach the succeeding generations about sculpting,” he said.

Organisers of the Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2024 on Saturday revealed the final list of participants expected to take part in the pageant, as the show draws nearer.

A bevy of 20 beauties was trimmed from the initial list of 32 after fans voted, with subsequent interviews being carried by the organisers of the pageant.

The pageant will be held on May 18 at Harare’s Hippodrome Auditorium.

The 20 are Amanda Peresu (Bulawayo), Lompopoma Khumalo (Bulawayo), Sakhile Dube (Bulawayo), Stacey Hall (Bulawayo), Wendy Ndlovu (Bulawayo), Victoria Shoko (Bulawayo), Nozinhle Gumede (Bulawayo), Monalisa Kandava (Chinhoyi), Lisa Sibanda (Chitungwiza), Shelly Uzogba (Gweru), Pauline Marere (Masvingo), Natasha Njomboro (Harare), Hannah Brits (Harare), Letwin Chinomona (Harare), Melissa Vanham (Harare), Alisa Adams (Harare), Shelly Bent (Harare), Jessie Marisa (Harare), Tanyaradzwa Muparutsa (Harare) and Samantha Chikwanda (Mutare).

The finalists will go for a boot camp to prepare to strut their stuff on the ramp on May 18, where one of them will be crowned Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2024.

The winner will walk away with a car and cash prize. She will represent the country at the Miss Universe pageant scheduled for September 28 in Mexico.

In an interview, the pageant licence holder and national director, Tendai Hunda, said selecting the 20 finalists was a mammoth task as all the 32 girls were good in terms of talent and presentation. She said a team of judges selected the 20 with the help of the organising team.

“This year we managed to get, high-quality girls, who include those already beauty queens in their own right, title holders and commercial models,” she said.

“Our team had a tough time selecting the best 20, as all the 32 who had qualified put up a scintillating act. They did their interviews and project presentation, which was amazing. However, we wanted 20 girls who will then vie for the coveted title come May 18.”

Hunda, a former model, said they wanted 18 finalists but because of fan votes, they ended up having 20.

“We had fans voting for their favourite contestants to be on the finalists and there were two girls who had the highest marks, Pauline Marere and Wendy Ndlovu.”

“They then automatically qualified to be in the running. Again, during the selection process, the “Voice for Change” challenge was the toughest one and we are happy the girls managed to sail through,” she said.

She said that on May 11 they are conducting the official photo shoot with the girls. Preliminary judging will be done six days before the final event.

Asked about any international guests coming to grace the event, Hunda said they have sent some invites to some regional celebrities and established models.

“I will furnish you with details but we have a lot of surprises. This year is bigger and better, as we also have roped in some of the special taskforce team to push the brand of Miss Universe Zimbabwe,” she said.

Last year’s winner was Brooke Bruk Jackson, who represented the country at the 72nd Miss Universe pageant in El Salvador and finished in the top 10 Miss Universe 2023 Voice for Change Silver Finalists.

The Voice for Change Silver Finalist was about representing a global shifting tapestry of voices committed to making a difference.

She was selected together with Angola, Brazil, Chile, Lebanon, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa and Ukraine.

The finalists captured the audience’s attention and demonstrated a passion for positive change through their impactful advocacy videos. The competition went beyond traditional beauty pageant norms, allowing viewers to play an active role in shaping the outcome.

The just-ended concert by sungura doyen Alick Macheso in Chitungwiza, dubbed “Homecoming Show”, held at the Aquatic Complex on Saturday night was a clear testimony that there is no rivalry between him and Mark Ngwazi or any other artiste.

It can also be dubbed the reconciliation gig, after two of the country’s musicians, Ngwazi and Peter Moyo, reunited with their siblings, ending years of rivalry. Macheso also lifted the ban on his dancer, Selemani “Majuice” Mpochi.

The concert featured the likes of Mark and Tindo Ngwazi, Nicholas Zakaria, Peter Moyo, Tongai Obert Moyo and Macheso’s two sons, Esau and Tatenda.

The Aquatic Complex was filled and revellers were charmed to see Macheso performing alongside Mark Ngwazi.

In an interview with The Herald Entertainment, before the show started, Macheso dispelled rumours that he hates Ngwazi.

“Those are lies that I hate Mark Ngwazi. People can say whatever they want but I will never hate anyone in our industry.

“I like what he is doing, that is why I have decided to call him to be part of us at this concert,” he said.

About two years back, Ngwazi and Macheso released their albums namely “Nharo Nezvine Nharo” and “Tinosvitswa Nashe” in the same month respectively.

The release generated interest on social media platforms with some fans suggesting that Ngwazi intended to fight Baba Shero.

This time around, Macheso is set to release his 13th album on June 7 and Mark Ngwazi is releasing his seventh album, three weeks later on June 29.

Macheso added that he had no problem with that, saying competition in sungura was necessary so that the genre can withstand the massive competition from other genres like Zim Hip-Hop, Zimdancehall, and many more.

Ngwazi also opened up about his cordial relationship with Baba Shero.

He said that Baba Shero is his mentor and on many occasions he visits him for advice.",https://www.herald.co.zw/machesos-homecoming-show-turns-into-reconciliation-concert/,The Herald,Macheso’s ‘Homecoming Show’ turns into reconciliation concert

Organisers of the much-publicised speech competition dubbed, ‘Possible Speech Contest’ have said that the stage is set for the challenge which will see 25 children and youth taking part.

Scheduled to take place on May 1 at Harare Girls High School, the event will be hosted by International Youth Fellowship (IYF) in partnership with the City of Harare.

The competition will have 13-20 year-olds participating with each speaker getting not more than four minutes on selected topics.

Some of the topics on the programme include: ‘My Dream’-(The world I hope for in 10 years), ‘Touching Moments — (Happy and unforgettable moments), ‘A person I admire’, ‘Mental health awareness’ and ‘The youth drug problem and the role I play’.

The deadline for participants to have submitted their scripts has passed and organisers confirmed that they already have some which are now being marked.

In an interview with IYF country director Kyeongchan Yang Simon from Korea, said the stage is set and already the participants are geared for the show.

He said registration was via social media, on Facebook.

“We have received more entries this year from various children and youths across Zimbabwe,” he said.

“The main reason for this competition is to empower them and equip  them with knowledge on particular subjects as they will also give solutions according to their mindset, guided by us.

“This will also eradicate some of the social ills by our children in the community as they will be busy with what is important to their mental health.”

He said participants will walk away with certificates and hampers sponsored by their partners and corporates.

Mr Simon said officials from the Ministries of Education and Arts will be attending the event.

Meanwhile, the chairman and president of IYF Zimbabwe Professor James Shim has shared his solidarity message ahead of the competition. He encouraged the youngsters to be vigilant all the time.“People believe what they see and hear. They make judgements and decisions based on that. But when we don’t think deeply, we make wrong judgements and decisions,” he said.

“Because we often fall into illusions. Now, when the Japanese were looking at a map of Korea during the period of colonisation, they said: “It’s like a rabbit cowering”.

It was part of their brainwashing that you are weak and need protection of Japan. But if you look at it differently, it’s a strong tiger.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/all-set-for-speech-contest/,The Herald,All set for ‘Speech Contest’
