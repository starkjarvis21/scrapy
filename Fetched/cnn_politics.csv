politics,"Independent presidential candidateRobert F. Kennedy Jr.walked back hisopposition to any government limits on abortion accessina social media postFriday evening after coming under fire from anti-abortion advocates, including from within his own campaign. Kennedy said he believes “abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks,” while later adding he believes abortion should be restricted “in the final months of pregnancy.” Related articleTrump campaign sees RFK Jr. as a political problem – and wants him neutralized “Abortion has been a notoriously divisive issue in America, but actually I see an emerging consensus — abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks, and restricted thereafter,” Kennedy wrote on social media Friday. “Even in the reddest of red states, voters reject total abortion bans. And on the other end, almost no one supports gruesome third-trimester abortions except to save the life of the mother.” “I support the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point. I believe that point should be when the baby is viable outside the womb. Therefore I would allow appropriate restrictions on abortion in the final months of pregnancy, just as Roe v. Wade did,” he added. Kennedy’s comments come after he told podcast host Sage Steele he opposed any government limits on abortion access, even keeping abortion legal up until shortly prior to the delivery date of a child. That position drew condemnation from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, which said his comments rendered him “unacceptable to millions of pro-life voters nationwide.” On Friday, Angela Stanton King – a Kennedy campaign adviser who has helped him with outreach to Black voters and with criminal justice and abortion policies – criticized Kennedy’s opposition to government limits on abortion access. Later Friday, Stanton King said in asocial media postthat she spoke with Kennedy and said he agreed to clarify his position on abortion. The incident marks the second time where Kennedy has taken a clear-cut position on government limits on abortion access only for Kennedy’s comments to be walked back shortly afterwards. Last year, Kennedy told a reporter he would support a three-month federal abortion restriction, but his campaignquickly walked back that position.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-walks-back-opposition-abortion-limits/index.html,CNN,RFK Jr. walks back opposition to government limits on abortion
politics,"TheBiden administrationmoved Friday to terminate a decades-old agreement that governs conditions for migrant children in government custody, according to a court filing, which argues that the settlement was meant to be temporary. The 1997Flores settlement, as the agreement is known, requires the government to release children from government custody without unnecessary delay to sponsors, like parents or adult relatives, and dictates conditions by which children are held. The Health and Human Services Department is charged with the care of unaccompanied migrant children. The Biden administration has previously signaled that it planned to end the Flores agreement, instead preparing a federal regulation that, the administration argues, “faithfully implements” the requirements spelled out in the settlement, provides additional protections and responds to “unforeseen changed circumstances since 1997.” The regulation was published in late April. “By its own terms the FSA was meant to be temporary. The parties initially agreed that the FSA would terminate no later than five years after final court approval and then later agreed that the FSA would terminate 45 days after the INS published final regulations implementing the FSA,” Friday’s court filing reads. “The Rule is expansive and responsive to the changing needs of ORR’s (Unaccompanied Children) Program. ORR anticipates it will guide its operations and provide needed protections to unaccompanied children for years to come,” the filing adds, referring to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency within HHS. But immigration attorneys have expressed concern over the lack of outside oversight if the Flores settlement is terminated. “If the government were to prevail in its motion, HHS would no longer be bound by the Flores settlement. As Flores counsel, we would no longer be able to interview children in HHS custody, or file motions to enforce when the rights guaranteed by Flores are denied to children in HHS custody,” said Neha Desai, senior director of immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.

politics,"TheBiden administration said Fridaythat it is “reasonable to assess” that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces inGazain ways that are “inconsistent” with international humanitarian law but stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Thereportwhich wasdrafted by the State Departmentsaid that investigations into potential violations are ongoing but noted that the US does “not have complete information to verify” whether the US weapons “were specifically used” in alleged violations of international humanitarian law. “Given the nature of the conflict in Gaza, with Hamas seeking to hide behind civilian populations and infrastructure and expose them to Israeli military action, as well as the lack of USG personnel on the ground in Gaza, it is difficult to assess or reach conclusive findings on individual incidents. Nevertheless, given Israel’s significant reliance on U.S.-made defense articles, it is reasonable to assess that defense articles covered under NSM-20 have been used by Israeli security forces since October 7 in instances inconsistent with its IHL obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm,” the report said. The report, which covers the period from the outbreak of thewar with Hamason October 7 to late April, did not find that Israel has withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza in violation of US law. Although the report does not find Israel in violation of either of the terms of the memorandum, it is sharply critical of the toll of Israel’s military campaign. The findings of the report mark another stark moment in US-Israeli relations in the same week President Joe Bidenthreatened to restrict weapons transfersif Israel goes ahead with a major offensive in Rafah. Still, the ultimate finding that Israel’s assurances made under the national security memorandum are “credible and reliable” has already raised scrutiny among some lawmakers and incredulity among human rights and humanitarian organizations. The report did not mandate any actions be taken by the Israeli government, and it does not trigger any policy changes. The administration has largely avoided restricting military assistance to Israel, but in a significant shift ahead of the release of the report, Biden declared publicly in an interview with CNN this week that if Israel proceeds with a major offensive in the Gazan city, he would restrict the transfer of certain offensive weapons to Israel. The high-stakes report was declassified andtransmitted to Capitol Hill on Friday afternoon. The administration was required to make a determination on those two matters under a February national security memorandum, which Biden issued under pressure from Democratic lawmakers. It was the first time the US government had to make an assessment about Israel’s conduct in the seven months of the war with Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the terror group’s brutal October 7 attack, that has left more than 34,000 people dead and much of the coastal enclave destroyed. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the driving force behind the creation of the national security memorandum, expressed disappointment in the report. “The administration ducked all the hard questions about making the actual determination,” the Maryland Democrat told reporters Friday evening. “I think what they’re trying to do is make clear that they recognize how bad the situation is, but they don’t want to have to take any action to hold the Netanyahu government accountable for what’s happening.” Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, agreed with Van Hollen’s remarks, telling CNN that the report is “a massive diplomatic dodge.” “On the one hand, it says that it’s very reasonable to conclude that there’s been restriction of aid, it’s very reasonable to conclude that our weapons have been used in violation of international law and then it proceeds to say that we just don’t want to give an answer on that yet,” Merkley said on “Erin Burnett OutFront.” The Oregon Democrat is one of the few members of Congress to step foot in Rafah, visiting in January. “Clearly, politics come into this and strategy comes into this, but it is frustrating because it’s so important at this moment that we use the leverage we have to persuade Israel to change its conduct,” he said. Earlier Friday, Van Hollen also said that “the purpose of this report was not to provide a snapshot in time” and accused the administration of taking Israel’s assurances at “face value,” despite investigations by human rights groups finding violations of the law. However, a senior State Department official said that it was always intended to be retrospective, and that there are processes underway to evaluate ongoing activity. There is no deadline for any conclusions to be made under those processes. The report notes that “in any conflict involving foreign partners, it is often difficult to make swift, definitive assessments or determinations on whether specific U.S. defense articles or services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law.” “However, there have been sufficient reported incidents to raise serious concerns,” it said. “While Israel has the knowledge, experience, and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations, the results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases,” the report said. According to the senior State Department official, the compilation of the report has been a useful tool for the Biden administration to go to the government of Israel and insist on getting information, and on behavior changes. That official said the report would be shared with the Israeli government. Biden administration officials have for months called on Israel to do more to curb the civilian death toll and allow more aid into Gaza. On humanitarian aid, the report notes the US government “has had deep concerns during the period since October 7 about action and inaction by Israel that contributed significantly to a lack of sustained and predictable delivery of needed assistance at scale, and the overall level reaching Palestinian civilians – while improved – remains insufficient.” However, it states that they “do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance within the meaning of section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act,” which bars assistance to governments found to be intentionally restricting aid. The report calls the “the impact of Israel’s military operations on humanitarian actors” a specific area of concern, citing a series of incidents, including thedeadly strikeon a World Central Kitchen aid convoy. Following that strike last month, Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in a call that Israel had to do more to address the humanitarian situation or there would be a change in US policy. In recent weeks, US officials said Israel had taken important measures following that conversation, but that more still needed to be done. However, following the launch of “limited” Israeli military operations in Rafah, where millions of Palestinians have fled, humanitarian aid access has once again plummeted. The report was the subject of intense debate for months across the administration. Human rights organizations have assessed that Israel’s military campaign has violated humanitarian law. Late last month, Amnesty International assessed that US-supplied weapons to Israel have been used “in serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and in a manner that is inconsistent with US law and policy.” An Amnesty International official said Friday that “this report seems like the international version of ‘thoughts and prayers’: admitting there’s a problem but not doing anything meaningful to prevent the further loss of lives.” “Despite President Biden’s vague comments earlier this week, his administration today made its position loud and clear: it points fingers and takes swift action when an actor the US government considers an adversary violates international law, but treats the government of Israel as above the law, even while acknowledging the overwhelming evidence that Israeli forces are violating international law and killing Palestinian civilians with US weapons on US taxpayer dime,” said Amanda Klasing, National Director of Government Relations and Advocacy at Amnesty International USA. Van Hollen on Friday said that “it is not credible that the US government has less information than organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam.” A senior State Department official said they couldn’t speak to the standards for the assessments made by those organizations but said the US government process was very diligent and took into consideration any accountability measures undertaken by the Israeli government. The president also acknowledged to CNN that “civilians have been killed as a consequence of” US-supplied bombs. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said Biden was speaking to “the tragic loss of civilian life throughout this conflict,” not a legal determination under international humanitarian law. Humanitarian aid organizations also questioned the findings of the report. “We are confused and dismayed by the Biden administration’s report to Congress, and in particular, its findings that Israel is not impeding the provision of aid to Gaza,” said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps. “Humanitarian organizations have publicly and repeatedly detailed a litany of obstructions by Israel over the last seven months that have made it impossible to deliver humanitarian assistance to the 2.2 million people in Gaza whose lives depend on it,” she said. “Yet more compelling than the testimony of aid organizations is the horrifying situation of the population of Gaza, trapped in a conflict zone and facing starvation,” she continued. “If humanitarian aid were being adequately facilitated—as the NSM calls for—1.1 million people would not be facing catastrophic famine conditions a few miles away from available food. The very fact that the US government has airdropped assistance and spent significant effort and resources constructing a floating pier for maritime deliveries indicates officials had already come to the conclusion that aid delivery was being ‘directly or indirectly’ impeded.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-israel-gaza-war-report/index.html,CNN,Biden admin says it’s ‘reasonable to assess’ Israel used American weapons in ways ‘inconsistent’ with international law
politics,"The US is trying to negotiate an agreement with themilitary junta that took over Nigerlast July to leave behind a small contingent of US forces, even as a broad withdrawal order has been issued to enable the departure of the majority of the less than 1,000 US troops in the West African nation, according to US officials. While some US officials have started conversations with Niger about what the withdrawal will look like, the civilian head of US special operations told CNN this week that the Pentagon has yet to have more detailed conversations with Niger, which will largely focus more on logistics of the withdrawal. Officials said a US delegation will travel to Niger over the weekend to discuss how it will be carried out. “We’ll make the most out of the situation that was presented to us but the intent is in Niger, to draw down to a level that the Nigerians can live with,” Chris Maier, assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, told CNN. “Niger is pretty profound in the decision of the government there … to have us depart or at least go to very low numbers,” Maier said. Among the issues defense officials must resolve in their meetings with Niger’s government is an agreement to allow US military flights in and out of the country. Since the coup in July, airspace has been closed over Niger to foreign militaries who have all had to submit individual requests for airspace to conduct military flights, one US official told CNN. A US military official explained that the withdrawal will come in phases over a period of months. The phase currently happening is the breakdown of anything not necessary for life or safety and security, which is being prepped to be taken out of the country. The footprint will continue to shrink in phases as equipment and personnel not deemed necessary are moved out of country. The official also said that the hope of having a small number of troops remaining in the country is largely wishful thinking at this point despite the conversations still ongoing, as Niger’s government has been clear it wants US forces out. US officials said the volatile situation in Niger is just the latest signal of growing instability on the continent of Africa, where a wave of military coups over the last several years has imperiled the American presence there and offered an opportunity for Russia to grow its influence. The US military footprint in Africa is relatively small and nominally is focused on counterterrorism efforts, but officials also believe that Africa is key in the global battle for influence between Russia and the United States. Niger’s military governmentendedits military agreement with the US in March, andfor several months nowRussian forces have been operating in different camps of the same base housing US troops. In addition to Niger’s expulsion of US forces, Chad has threatened to cancel its status of forces agreement with the US, further destabilizing the US’ presence on the continent. Although the small number of US troops in Chad makes it a less obvious military loss, a third US official said that it could be a bellwether for stability — and American influence — across the continent. Gen. Michael Langley, the head of US Africa Command,told Congress in Marchthat a “number of countries” in Africa were “at the tipping point of actually being captured by the Russian Federation as they are spreading some of their false narratives.” Maier echoed the same, saying Russia and China have “invested a lot more than we have” in information operations, which helps spread their influence. American officials said it is difficult for the US to compete directly with what Russia is willing to offer some of the military leaders that have taken over governments in Africa. Russia can offer immediate security assistance — including weapons — in the fight against terrorism, assistance that comes with far fewer conditions than American aid. “My concern among others is that the partnership that we rely on fundamentally to, we hope, help these countries is not there anymore, or they’ve replaced it in some instances with the elixir of Russia that promises things that are more rapid that might be what some of these governments, especially the coup governments, think they need in the short term,” Maier said. The fear, according to the second US official, is that growing instability could create a swath of nations across Africa where the US can’t operate safely but Russia potentially can. That could have dramatic security implications beyond Africa, particularly if it imperils safe US access to the Mediterranean where the US military has been operating since Hamas’ invasion of Israel in October. When it comes to Africa, the US “may be in a situation where we’re increasingly on the outside looking in,” Maier said. But he added that it could present an opportunity to show the ineffectiveness of Russia’s offers to African nations. “Now some of these coup regimes have decided that they are going to go with the Russians, so now they’re the dog that caught the car,” he said. “And if there aren’t results — not only security space, but a lot of the other things that are part of governance — then the facts will start to outstrip even the most sophisticated mis and disinformation over time.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/us-niger-forces-talks/index.html,CNN,"US hopes to maintain some forces in Niger as talks on withdrawal continue, officials say"

politics,"Supreme Court JusticeClarence Thomasrepeatedly pushed back on his critics during remarks Friday at a judicial conference in Alabama, lamenting what he described as the “nastiness” and “lies” directed at him and calling Washington a “hideous place.” Asked whether his jurisprudence required a degree of courage, Thomas said he didn’t view himself as courageous – particularly when compared with servicemembers, and firefighters and people who defuse bombs. Thomas said he was simply doing his job. “Being in Washington, you have to get used to particularly people who are reckless,” Thomas, a conservative and the court’s most senior associate justice, said. “They don’t bomb you, necessarily, but they bomb your reputation or your good name or your honor. And that’s not a crime but they can do as much harm that way.” Speaking at the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals conference in Point Clear, Alabama, Thomas argued that it would be a disservice to those soldiers and first responders “not to sit at my desk and make decisions with a lifetime appointment that we know are the right decisions.” Thomas, while not speaking directly to aseries of reports about ethicsthat have plagued him for months, repeatedly returned to his critics without prompting from US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, who moderated the discussion. “My wife and I, the last two or three years, it’s been – just the nastiness and the lies – it’s just incredible,” Thomas said. Related articleJudges from around the country say Trump can be held accountable for January 6. What will the Supreme Court say? Thomas and his wife, Ginni, have been the target of a good deal of criticism in recent years. Several of Thomas’ critics, including Democratic members of Congress, havecalled on him to recuse himselffrom Supreme Court cases involving theJanuary 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitolbecause of his wife’s efforts to reverse the 2020 presidential election in former President Donald Trump’s favor. Ginni Thomas hasacknowledged attending Trump’s rallybefore the Capitol attack. Justice Thomas hasdeclined to recuse himselffrom cases this year involving the January 6 attack, including a blockbuster appeal regarding Trump’s claims of absolute immunity from criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the election results. Thomas has also faced criticism for accepting private jet travel and posh vacations from Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, first reported byProPublica. In response to the blowback, Thomasupdated his financial disclosure forms, and the Supreme Courtadopted a code of conductfor the first time last year. At one point on Friday, Thomas told a story about a walk he took with a friend before breaking off into an aside. “That’s before they started attacking my friends,” Thomas said. “I hope I still have some.” As he has in the past, Thomas also spared little criticism for Washington, DC. “I think what you’re gonna find, and especially in Washington, [is] people pride themselves in being awful,” Thomas said one point. The remark elicited laughter in the room, until Thomas continued. “It is a hideous place, as far as I’m concerned,” Thomas said, noting that he liked to visit other places where people “don’t pride themselves in doing harmful things merely because they have the capacity to do it.” Thomas, 75, also appeared to lament aloss of trust within the Supreme Court, telling the conference that thestunning leak of a draft abortion opinion in 2022wouldn’t have happened when he joined the court in 1991. It wasn’t the first time Thomas has made those points – he once likened the leak to an “infidelity” – but his remarks Friday suggested the fallout from the leak of the decision overturning Roe v. Wade may still be top of mind. Related articleJustice Clarence Thomas chooses not to recuse himself from another January 6-related case “We may have been a dysfunctional family, but we were a family,” Thomas said of the court when he first joined in 1991. “It would be inconceivable that anyone would leak an opinion of the court or do anything to intentionally harm one another.” Thomas also became the latest justice in recent weeks to raise concern with the Supreme Court’s applications docket, the process the court uses to handle emergency requests. That docket has come under fierce criticism in recent years, in part because the court often decides the requests on a short timeline, usually without oral argument and often with orders that do not indicate how the justices voted. “I think there’s some concern about that among my colleagues – certainly with me – because it short circuits our process,” Thomas said. “The way that we’re doing it now, I think, is not a thorough way of dealing with very, very difficult issues.” As he returned to his critics, Thomas suggested the lesson he had taken away from the last year of controversy was that he would not react with “nastiness for nastiness.” “You have some choices. You don’t get to prevent people from doing horrible things or saying horrible things,” Thomas said. But, he said, he had come to accept “the fact that they can’t change you unless you permit that.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/clarence-thomas-pushes-back-critics/index.html,CNN,Justice Clarence Thomas decries Washington as ‘hideous’ and pushes back on ‘nastiness’ of critics
politics,"AsRobert F. Kennedy Jr.sustains his support in public polls and makes steady progress on gaining ballot access in states across the country, his independent presidential bid is confounding the campaign of former President Donald Trump and its Republican allies. In recent weeks, Kennedy has gone from a perceived nuisance to a political problem that the Trump campaign is eager to swiftly extinguish, according to conversations with multiple people close to the former president. Trump himself has noticeably escalated his attacks on Kennedy in recent weeks, includingposting a lengthy videoto social media on Thursday that labeled him as a “Democrat plant” who will pull votes away from his campaign to help President Joe Biden, and urged Republicans not to cast a “wasted protest vote.” The shift comes asrecent pollsshow that Kennedy could cut into Trump’s support just as much as he could draw votes away from Biden, with the results serving as an apparent warning for Republicans who have dismissed the independent candidate thus far, the sources say. The consensus held by Trump’s top advisers and allies had long been that Biden has more to lose from the presence of independents, and Kennedy specifically, in November. But the former president’s team has taken notice of Kennedy’s standing in some state polls and uptick in media attention, including regular appearances on conservative networks like Newsmax and Fox News, during which he’s openly courted anti-establishment voters. That’s sparked a more concerted effort from Republicans to try and prevent Kennedy from eating into any pro-Trump support. Trump’s advisers and those close to the former president told CNN they still view Kennedy as likely hurting Biden more. However, they privately acknowledge that his impact on Trump’s candidacy varies on a state-by-state basis. They also dismiss the notion that he could be perceived as a serious threat to the former president, but they argue their increased attacks against Kennedy are more an effort to halt any consideration from current or potential Trump supporters from casting their vote for the independent candidate. “RFK is a problem, not a threat,” one senior Trump adviser told CNN, who singled out Pennsylvania as one critical battleground state where Kennedy could hurt Trump, arguing voters in the Keystone State may be drawn more to a candidate who is neither Trump nor Biden. As CNN previously reported, there are some in Trump’s orbit who are concerned about Kennedy qualifying for the presidential debates and believe that having earlier debates would make it easier to keep Kennedy off the stage before he could gather further momentum in the polls. “It’s not that he’s a threat. A lot of it depends on the state, and it’s still not clear who he’s taking more from,” a person close to Trump said. “If we can make people on the right, who might be open minded to him, hate him very easily because he’s so liberal. Why not weigh him down as much as possible with conservative or conservative leaning voters?” CNN has reached out to Kennedy’s campaign for comment. Trump’s teamcreated a playbook months agoto go on offense against Kennedy and define him as a “liberal parading in conservative’s clothing,” as one senior Trump adviser described him to CNN, pointing to a series of his policies on climate change and abortion to paint him as part of the progressive wing of the Democratic party. But in the months since, the messaging has varied. While Trump’s team and Republican National Committee officials stuck to the script and painted Kennedy as a far-left Democrat who doesn’t embody conservative values, the former president himself often had a different take. At a campaign stop at a Harlem bodega during Trump’s criminal trial last month, the former president ignored questions about whether he would consider Kennedy as a potential running mate, after Kennedy suggested emissaries of Trump’s had reached out about the prospect — something Trump’s campaign adamantly denied. Trump instead offered mild praise of Kennedy. Days later, he called Kennedy “a nice guy” during an interview with Real America’s Voice, adding he wasn’t sure whether Kennedy hurt him or Biden more. “Well, I think he’s a nice guy. I’ve known him. He’s extremely liberal. He’s more liberal than anybody,” Trump told the radio host. “They say he hurts Biden, I think, I’m not sure that that’s true. But he might hurt Biden a little bit more, you don’t know.” Flash forward to May, and Trump has adopted a more aggressive stance toward his independent rival. He has repeatedly attacked Kennedy on Truth Social, includinglabeling himas “a Radical Left Lunatic” and calling him “the dumbest member of the Kennedy Clan,” as well as needling Kennedy’s positions on vaccines and environmental policy, among others. Asked about Trump ratcheting up his attacks, a Trump campaign adviser told CNN: “We’ve seen an uptick in the amount of coverage he’s getting. And you know, we just want to reiterate our message. We want Trump to do what he does, what he does with everyone else. He separates the person from the politician.” CNN’s Aaron Pellish contributed to this story.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/trump-campaign-rfk-jr/index.html,CNN,Trump campaign sees RFK Jr. as a political problem – and wants him neutralized

politics,"The US announced on Friday a new $400 million military aid package toUkraine. The package includes weapons Ukraine has been asking for, including Patriot missile system munitions, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMAR) systems and ammunition, Stinger anti-air missiles, 155mm artillery rounds, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs), among other equipment. “As President Biden has made clear, the United States and the international coalition we have assembled will continue to stand with Ukraine in its defense of its freedom,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. The announcement marks the second Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package since President Joe Biden signed a long-delayed national security supplemental securing $60 billion in funding for Ukraine. Last month, just moments after Biden signed the legislation, the US announced a $1 billion PDA package to Ukraine. Bidensaid at the timethat shipments of the equipment to Ukraine would begin “in the next few hours.” And just two days later, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced ahistoric $6 billionlong-term investment package to purchase new equipment for Ukraine. The $6 billion package — the largest the US has announced — is under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). USAI is different from than the PDA package in that it contracts with the US defense industry to purchase new equipment, whereas PDAs pull equipment from existing US stocks. While some equipment under the PDA can arrive within days of the announcement, support under USAI takes longer; Austin said at the time that the Pentagon was “going to move as fast as we can to get them the capability as fast as industry can produce.” On Friday, the State Department also announced the $30 million sale of HIMARS to Ukraine, a rocket launcher that Kyiv’s military has used to great effect against Russian forces. The emergency sale, which includes three of the HIMARS vehicles, will be paid for by Germany on behalf of Ukraine. Butofficials have told CNNthat Russia is seeking to exploit that lag time and step up its attacks on Ukraine as the embattled country waits for assistance to arrive. The lag in those shipments is made more severe given the months-long delay in aid as Congress debated the supplemental legislation. On Wednesday evening, Ukrainian authorities said Russia launched dozens of missiles and drones on Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure. On Friday, a Ukrainian military source told CNN that Russian forces had penetrated at least one kilometer inside northern Ukraine in an assault on a border town on Thursday evening. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Russia “launched a new wave of counteroffensive actions in ([northern Kharkiv region). Ukraine met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery.” “But our military and military command were aware of this and anticipated their forces to meet the enemy with fire,” he said. “Now there is a fierce battle in this area. … I think as of now we have stopped the enemy with artillery fire.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.

Bush administration has made him more skeptical of presidential assertions of regulatory power. His comments on the issue (he also discussed Taylor Swift and Caitlin Clark) were especially salient in light of the many challenges to the Biden administration policies on which the court is expected to rule by the end of June. Related galleryIn pictures: Taylor Swift’s ‘Eras Tour’ Referring to his 2001-2006 tenure as a lawyer for Bush, Kavanaugh said he was “in the room” as regulations were written and saw first-hand the “pressures” on administrations to push the limits of their statutory power, whether over the environment, immigration or health care. “It gives me a good, for want of a better term, B.S. detector,” he said. “When the executive branch says, ‘We can’t possibly do this.’ … I think to myself … I saw it done.” Kavanaugh observed that presidential candidates regularly campaign on a reform agenda but then become stymied in their priorities by the legislative process and congressional gridlock. That creates an incentive for presidents to push the boundaries of their regulatory authority, he said, emphasizing that the phenomenon affects both political parties. “The judiciary is there to help police those boundaries,” Kavanaugh said. The comments of Kavanaugh, a 2018 appointee of former President Donald Trump, may hint at the conservative court majority’s resolution of pending disputes testing the bounds of an array of federal regulation. Since the six-justice conservative majority coalesced in 2020, the court has taken longer strides to constrain federal regulators, from the environment and consumer finance to public health and workplace safety.

Natural Resources Defense Council, that requires federal judges to defer to US agencies’ views of their statutory mandates for policy. Business groups, backed by Republican-run states, contend the Chevron principle has led to unlawful bureaucratic intrusions and given the government the upper hand in litigation. The Biden administration, defending the Chevron precedent and multiple agency policies now under challenge, has stressed the importance of executive-branch expertise and comprehensive nationwide protections for the public good. Kavanaugh’s hourlong appearance Friday in the ballroom of an Austin hotel came as the high court enters its tensest weeks, negotiating in private to resolve dozens of cases by the traditional late June deadline. He answered questions from 5th Circuit Chief Judge Priscilla Richman at the circuit’s annual judicial conference. Related article‘Pretty unheard of’: Caitlin Clark draws 13,000 in home preseason debut as Indiana Fever win 83-80 By and large, Richman’s questions were on the lighter side, including those that opened a window on Kavanaugh’s extracurricular life. He said that his two high school daughters, now a sophomore and senior, control much of his off-bench time. He attended his first Taylor Swift concert in 2012, he told Richman after she asked if he had attended anEras Tour concert. Yes, the justice said, Kavanaugh describing himself as “way ahead of the curve” with his Swiftie fandom. And he has taken his daughters to multiple NCAA basketball tournaments, including thefirst round in Iowa last March. The justice recounted that on the Thursday night before that tournament weekend, his older daughter was talking about players she knew, from her own high school basketball team, that would be competing against Iowa’s Caitlin Clark. Kavanaugh’s younger daughter said, “We should go!” A few beats later, Kavanaugh agreed: “We should go. We went. … I got on StubHub, got the tickets, got the flights, probably one of the most expensive 48 hours.” But he added, “To go to Iowa and see the phenomena of Caitlin Clark. That’s a lifetime memory that I did on the spur of the moment.” On a far more serious note about his daughters, Kavanaugh said that they have grown up with constant court police security. Asked about the intense security for individual justices since 2022, when the opinion reversing Roe v. Wade first leaked, the justice said his security detail is “24/7 at the home” and accompanies him when he travels. When Richman asked if protesters still show up at his home, a pattern that intensified after he joined the Dobbs ruling reversing Roe, Kavanaugh said, “occasionally … not as much. I think I’ll leave it there.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/brett-kavanaugh-presidential-power-caitlin-clark-taylor-swift-security/index.html,CNN,"Brett Kavanaugh speaks about presidential power, his Taylor Swift fandom and an expensive trip to see Caitlin Clark"
politics,"President Joe Biden on Friday signed a one-week extension for federal aviation programs ahead of a key deadline after the Senate passed the measure Thursday night, the White House announced. The president, who is currently traveling in San Francisco, signed the Federal Aviation Administration funding extension using the autopen – a device used for automatic signatures – in order to ensure there was no lapse in funding, a White House official said. The bill was transmitted to the White House Friday afternoon, the official said. The use of the autopen, which was first used by President Barack Obama to sign legislation, has been a rarity in the Biden administration. The White House has gone to great lengths at times to fly physical bills to  Biden while he’s traveling abroad, including a $40 billion Ukraine aid package the president signed while in South Korea in 2022 and a 2022 bill to avert a government shutdown while the president was on vacation in St. Croix. The Senate also approved a bipartisan FAA reauthorization bill that renews authority for the agency for the next five years on Thursday night. The House will next need to pass that legislation. That bill would renew authority for the agency for the next five years and aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislationseeks to addressthe nation’s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring, includes strengthened consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays, and would implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions. Although there is broad bipartisan support for the legislation, the package touched off contentious debate over some of its provisions. One flashpoint centered aroundflights at Reagan National Airportjust outside of Washington, DC – with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package. Ultimately, however, there were no votes on amendments. Some lawmakers argue that adding flights will give consumers more choices and bring down prices, while others say it would increase congestion and delays at the airport. The House now has until next week to pass the Senate-passed, five-year reauthorization bill and send it to Biden’s desk.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-week-faa-extension-autopen/index.html,CNN,Biden signs one-week FAA extension via autopen
politics,"One of Donald Trump’s closest White House aides wrapped up her testimony Friday in theformer president’s hush money trial, clearing the way for the prosecution’s key witness to take the stand on Monday. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer and lawyer, is expected to testify Monday, according to a person familiar with the case, where he will speak to the hush money agreement he helped negotiate in 2016 with Stormy Daniels and how Trump repaid him the following year. Related live-storyMichael Cohen set to testify at Trump hush money trial Monday Cohen’s testimony is the lynchpin to prosecutors’ charges that Trump illegally falsified business records by concealing the reimbursement of Cohen to keep the payments hidden before the 2016 election. In anticipation of calling the former president’s onetime fixer, however, prosecutors introduced a slew of text messages and phone records into evidence for the jury, via several custodial witnesses. Prosecutors say it’s entirely possible they could rest their case by the end of next week. Here are the takeaways from day 15 of the Trump hush money trial: Cohen is expected to take the stand Monday, putting him face-to-face with his former boss. He is expected to testify to his role in negotiating the hush money payment to Daniels on Trump’s behalf, as well as how he was reimbursed through retainer payments in 2017 that are at the heart of the charges against Trump. With Cohen’s testimony implicating Trump, however, comes all of the baggage that accompanies the former president’s longtime fixer. Cohen himself was federally charged with campaign finance violations, tax crimes and lying to Congress in previous testimony. He’s changed his story as he turned from loyal Trump defender to chief antagonist afterpleading guilty to the federal charges in 2018. His testimony in the fall during Trump’s civil fraud trial foreshadowed some of the challenges prosecutors can face having him on the stand, as he appeared to change his story about the direction he received from Trump about his financial statements during his testimony. Cohen’s credibility with the jury may make-or-break Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case, so it will be high stakes for the prosecution when Cohen is sworn in next week. Ahead of Cohen’s expected testimony, Trump attorney Todd Blanche urged Judge Juan Merchan to order Cohen to stop talking about the trial and Trump. Trump is not allowed to talk about Cohen because of the gag order in place. But, Blanche said, Cohen is nevertheless allowed to attack him, pointing to a TikTok video Cohen posted this week wearing a T-shirt showing Trump behind bars. “Our request that the court order the government to instruct the witness to not talk about president trump or this case until the case is over,” Blanche said. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass responded that prosecutors have repeatedly instructed Cohen and all of the other witnesses in the case not to speak publicly about it. “The fact of the matter is, we have no control over what they do,” he conceded. Merchan has already said he cannot gag witnesses in the case. But he sympathized with Blanche’s position and said that he would “direct the people to communicate to Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements” about this case or Trump. Merchan told the prosecutors to send the message saying that it “comes from the bench and you’re communicating that on behalf of the bench.” Cohen has posted on social media attacking Trump since the trial began, though he claimed at one point he was going to stop. Trump, often in response, has repeatedly been found in violation of the judge’s gag order for his comments about Cohen. Trump exchanged smiles with his former White House assistant Madeleine Westerhout, who wrapped up her testimony Friday that began one day prior. She raised her eyebrows and smiled at Trump who smiled back at her and mouthed something as she left the courtroom. On cross-examination, Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Westerhout to reiterate that she knows the former president to care about his family. Westerhout testified that she remembered Trump was upset after the Stormy Daniels story came out in 2018. Westerhout acknowledged on the stand that he didn’t specifically speak about his family in their conversation about the story, but, “My understanding was he knew it would be hurtful to his family.” Westerhout testified that Trump signed scores of documents a day while multitasking on the phone or in meetings, and she said she’d seen him signing checks without reviewing them. Related articleEx-Trump Org. CFO sentenced to 5 months in jail after testifying falsely about size of Trump triplex apartment She also testified that personal mail like Trump’s checks used a back channel via an employee’s home address so he could get and handle them faster than if they were processed by the White House’s cumbersome system for processing personal mail. Westerhout also distanced Trump from then-Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselbergonce he took office. “In fact, you really don’t recall any calls specifically between him and Allen Weisselberg?” Necheles asked. “No, he spoke to so many people,” Westerhout said. Trump’s former assistant said she’s “not even sure it’s true” that Trump spoke with Weisselberg about a check – something prosecutors have suggested in reference to the Cohen reimbursements. After Westerhout left the stand, prosecutors spent the rest of the day calling a series of custodial witnesses to introduce cell phone records into evidence. It made for a dry day of testimony, but it also provided key evidence that prosecutors plan to use to try to convince the jury that Trump is guilty of falsifying business records. Those records included a summary of the 34 charges against Trump – 11 invoices, 12 vouchers, and 11 checks. Through a Manhattan district attorney’s office paralegal, prosecutors introduced a summary explaining how the charges correlated with the documents in evidence. In addition, prosecutors introduced a series of text messages between Stormy Daniels’ then-manager Gina Rodriguez and National Enquirer editor in chief Dylan Howard in 2016. In the messages, the two discuss whether American Media Inc. would buy Daniels’ story – and for how much – before giving a play-by-play of the status of the negotiations and payment Cohen ultimately made to Daniels’ attorney in late October 2016. The texts are notable because neither Howard nor Rodriguez is expected to testify in the trial. Some of the texts were introduced through David Pecker, who was Howard’s boss, but prosecutors used a paralegal to show more of them to the jury this week. “We’re not doing the Trump deal,” Rodriguez texted Howard on October 17, 2016. “Keith (Davidson) gave me a heads up. What happened?” Howard responded. “They didn’t pay when they said they would and they keep trying to buy more time,” Rodriguez responded. The texts corroborate what Daniels and Davidson have testified so far that the deal briefly fell apart in mid-October – and will also likely help bolster Cohen’s credibility when he takes the stand next week. Steinglass said that prosecutors expect to call two more witnesses, and then rest. “And I think it’s entirely possible we will rest by the end of next week,” he added. When the prosecution rests, it will be Trump’s turn. It’s not clear how long he will put on a case in defense – a question that is likely to rest largely on whether or not Trump himself takes the stand. The judge also threw a potential curveball of his own on Friday when Trump’s lawyers objected to allowing the settlement agreement of Weisselberg into evidence. Trump’s lawyers argued that the severance agreement was prejudicial to the jury, calling Weisselberg an “uncalled government witness” because he is currently in jail afterpleading guiltyearlier this year to perjury charges. Prosecutors responded that the settlement agreement itself would help to explain why Weisselberg was not called and also argued that they expect Weisselberg to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Merchan interjected by asking prosecutors whether they had actually compelled Weisselberg to testify, which they had not. “It seems to me we want to explain why he’s not here without taking the effort of trying to explain that we tried to get him here,” Merchan said, suggesting they could bring Weisselberg in without the jury present to see what he would say. Prosecutors did not seem thrilled by the idea – Trump’s attorneys noted he wasn’t on prosecutors’ original witness list – but it’s the kind of unexpected appearance that could extend the length of the trial.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/takeaways-friday-may-10-trump-trial/index.html,CNN,Takeaways from Day 15 of the Donald Trump hush money trial
politics,"The Biden administration is set to unveil a sweeping restructuring of former President Donald Trump’s trademarktariffs on Chinese imports,according to sources familiar with the matter. The announcement, expected as early as next week, would see tariffs dialed up significantly in some industries seenas strategic to the US economyand kept in place or dialed back in others deemed less critical to national security, the sources said. Importers of electric vehicles, solar components and critical minerals made in China are likely to see those levies rise significantly – to as high as 100% in the case of electric vehicles, these sources said. The changes come as President Joe Biden refines a campaign pitch based on protecting domestic industries from state-sponsored competition, while encouraging clean energy investments in the US that have become the pillars of his presidential platform. The changes are the result of a mandatory review that the Office of the US Trade Representative began in 2022, two years after the US and China’s “Phase One” trade deal went into effect, formalizing the tariff levels that Trump was known to set on social media. Under US trade law, the economic impact and effectiveness of tariff programs must be studied and investigated every four years. Adam Hodge, former aide at Biden’s National Security Council and the Office of the US Trade Representative, said the new tariffs – taken together with other policies enacted by Treasury and Commerce – should ease some anxiety among the electorate. “The Biden administration has neutralized China as a campaign issue,” said Hodge, now a managing director at Bully Pulpit International. Trump – Biden’s opponent in November and the architect of the existing tariff program that taxes some $300 billion in Chinese goods at US ports of entry –has proposed charginga 60% tariff on all goods coming from China and 10% on goods imported from everywhere else. Biden’s proposal would represent a more curated approach, albeit an approach that is inherently a response to actions already initiated by his predecessor. Some economists have warned that increased tariffs risk reigniting a trade war with China, hurting the US economy in the process. Tariffs are essentially a tax on US businesses and consumers,adding to the cost of imported goods.That could send inflation higher and hurt job growth. Americans have paid more than $230 billion to date for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum and Chinese-made goods, according toUS Customs and Border Protection. More than half of the duties have been collected during the Biden administration. Strategic importance to the economy, in an election year, also carries political importance. Both candidates have been campaigning across the manufacturing-heavy swing states known as the “blue wall” critical to both candidates’ prior election victories. In an April speech in Pittsburgh,nicknamed “Steel City,” Biden called for the tripling of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and shipbuilding materials – an effort to raise the cost of non-US products to promote American manufacturing and jobs. The Biden administration had planned to release the results of the review in advance of the Pittsburgh speech, the sources familiar with the matter said, but ended up delaying the release. The Office of the US Trade Representative now faces a deadline at the end of May to decide whether companies whose products had been granted exclusions from certain tariffs would see those exclusions extended or denied. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen discussed US concerns with China’s non-market practices in bilateral meetings with Chinese leaders in early April, concerns echoed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken in meetings later that month. Yellen is planning to join other finance ministers in the Group of Seven nations representing the world’s wealthiest democracies in Italy at the end of May, where the group will discuss the agenda for the upcoming June summit in Puglia, Italy. For more than a year, the Biden administration has been urging its allies in the European Union to place hefty tariffs on electric vehicles imported into the bloc, stressing the risk China poses to domestic car manufacturing and urging solidarity in standing up to a non-market economy. “It’s important for the US to make this move in advance of the EU’s investigation into Chinese EVs,” said Clete Willems, partner at Akin Gump and former deputy director of the National Economic Council during the Trump administration. Willems said the US’ position as a first mover on EV tariffs would give the EU “air cover.” The European Commission faces a July 4 deadline to decide how to proceed in its own investigation into electric vehicle subsidies.

politics,"Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court on Friday to intervene in theongoing legal fightover the state’s congressional districts, urging the high court to quickly resolve a dispute that has essentially left the state without a viable map for this year’s election. The emergency appeal came days after civil rights organizations and a group of Black voters separately asked the Supreme Court to step into the case. “Five days out from May 15 — the date by which the Louisiana Secretary of State needs to begin implementing a congressional map for the 2024 elections — Louisiana has no congressional map,” state officials told the Supreme Court. “Louisiana’s impossible situation in this redistricting cycle would be comical if it were not so serious.” At issue is a map drawn by state lawmakers that included a second majority-Black district in Louisiana’s six-district congressional plan. A conservative-leaning lower courtstruck down that maplast week, finding that it violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause. That new map with the two majority-Black districts was drawn in response to another court order that found an earlier map, which had only one majority-Black district, likely ran afoul of the Voting Rights Act. Civil rights groups say the two rulings have left the state “without a congressional map just months away from the 2024 elections.” The Supreme Court has asked the voters who challenged the second map for a response to the civil rights groups by midday Monday, setting up a possible decision as early as next week, once all the filings are submitted. Louisiana specifically asked the justices Friday to rely on a legal doctrinecalled the Purcell principle, which it sometimes invokes to stay out of messy election lawsuits as voting season approaches. The lower court’s “late-breaking” ruling “plus the court’s blowing through election deadlines in search of an imaginary, litigation-proof 2024 congressional map” should be enough to allow the most recently drawn map to stand for now, the state argued. Because the case raises fundamental questions about how mapmakers consider race when they redraw congressional boundaries every decade, the Supreme Court’s decision could have national implications. It could also affect control of the US House, given the narrow majority Republicans currently hold in that chamber.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/louisiana-congressional-map-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,Louisiana urges Supreme Court to quickly resolve congressional map fight in emergency request
politics,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.said he’s against government limits on abortion at the federal or state level, backing legal abortions through the entire gestational period while arguing the state should not play a role in determining abortion access. In a podcast interview with Sage Steele that was released Wednesday, Kennedy said he doesn’t “trust government to have jurisdiction over people’s bodies” and believes “we need to leave it to the woman … to make those decisions.” Kennedy stressed he believes “every abortion is a tragedy” and pledged as president to make child care more affordable to reduce pressures on women who are considering abortion due to high costs. When pressed by Steele if he supports allowing individual states to determine abortion access for women, Kennedy said, “We shouldn’t have government involved.” “I wouldn’t leave it to the states. My belief is that we should leave it to the woman. We shouldn’t have government involved,” Kennedy said. “Even if it’s full term?” Steele asked, referring to the possibility of an abortion near the expected delivery date of a child. “Even if it’s full term,” Kennedy replied. The position stands in contrast withprevious statementsKennedy has made on abortion, and with how his running mate Nicole Shanahan has characterized his abortion position. In an interview with Steele released last week, Shanahan said, “My understanding is that he absolutely believes in the limits on abortion.” When pressed by Steele to confirm if Kennedy supported no government limits on abortion, Shanahan said, “That is not my understanding of his position, and I think maybe there was a miscommunication there.” In a statement to CNN, Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said the candidate believes “late-term abortions are horrifying” and that the “the mother has the final say, and moral responsibility, in such decisions.” “He is committed to reducing the abortion rate by supporting mothers and families and implementing universally affordable child care,” Spear said. Kennedy’s comments to Steele reflect the most explicit articulation of his views on state or federal gestational limits on abortion. Last year, Kennedy told a reporter he wouldsupport a three-month federal abortion restriction, but his campaign quickly walked back that position. Kennedy has often avoided answering directly whether he supports limits on abortion while highlighting his plan to subsidize child care and expand access to adoption services. Kennedy acknowledged to Steele there is “a compelling argument” that the government should set a gestational limit on abortion access. He also conceded that his position is “not a very satisfactory outcome” because of the potential for “instances where bad things happen.” “I think there’s a very, very good argument, a compelling argument that the state has a interest in protecting a fully formed fetus. I absolutely think that that argument is very convincing,” Kennedy said. “But again, I come down to the fact that I don’t trust the state, and I think we need to trust the woman. And I don’t think that that’s a satisfactory outcome because there’s always going to be instances where bad things happen.” Kennedy said he believes cases where a woman would potentially undergo a late-term abortion would be driven by “extenuating circumstances” but reiterated his belief that the choice to have an abortion should be determined solely by the mother. “I don’t think any woman ever, ever in history has said, ‘I’m going to have a, you know, I’m going to have a baby, I’m going to get pregnant and carry that baby to eight months term and then I’m going to terminate the pregnancy.’ I don’t think anybody wants to do that,” Kennedy said. “I’m sure it has happened. I would say in almost all those cases, there’s extenuating circumstances.” “But I think, ultimately, nobody sets out to do that,” he added later. “And there are always some kind of extenuating circumstances that would make a mother make that kind of choice, a terrible, terrible choice which is, you know, you can’t overstate how bad that is. And I think, ultimately, we have to trust women.” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, slammed Kennedy on Thursday for his remarks, with the group’s president calling him a “true extremist.” “He would use the power of the federal government to wipe out protections for life in the states and impose unlimited abortion on demand all the way up to ‘full term,’ as he puts it, everywhere in America. That makes him unacceptable to millions of pro-life voters nationwide,” Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. Angela Stanton King, a Kennedy campaign adviser who has helped him with outreach to Black voters, criminal justice and abortion policies, criticized the candidate’s comments on Friday. She said it was the first time she had heard him voice such a perspective. “It is inexcusable to take the life of a full-term baby. Abortion at this stage does not prevent the need for delivery, as the baby must still be birthed, whether alive or deceased,” Stanton Kingsaid.

politics,"A federal appeals court on Fridayupheld the contempt-of-Congress convictionof Steve Bannon, the ex-adviser to former President Donald Trump who was found guilty after failing to comply with a subpoena from the House January 6 committee. Bannon’s conviction — and now, the DC Circuit’s affirmation of that conviction — is a boost to Congress’ leverage in its efforts going forward to obtain cooperation in its investigations. The US DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, including his claim that the trial court excluded evidence he should have been allowed to put before the jury in his defense. Bannon was sentenced to four months in federal prison, and that sentence was also upheld Friday by the appeals court. The ruling could pave the way for Bannon to eventually report to prison, though the timing is unclear. The judge who presided over Bannon’s trial previously agreed to let him hold off from serving his sentence while his appeal played out. In its ruling Friday, the three-judge appeals panel gave Bannon time to appeal its ruling to the full DC-based appeals court before it formally notifies the trial judge that the conviction was upheld. Bannon could also turn directly to the Supreme Court for additional appeals, possibly further delaying when he needs to start serving his prison term. Bannon’s attorneys did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. In the DC Circuit’s new ruling, Judge Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, backed the trial judge’s exclusion of an advice-of-counsel defense, as Bannon had claimed he had rebuffed the subpoena because of supposed executive privilege concerns expressed to him by his lawyer. “This exact ‘advice of counsel’ defense is no defense at all,” Garcia wrote, noting that the contempt law only required proof that Bannon “deliberately and intentionally” did not respond to the subpoena. His opinion was joined by Judge Cornelia Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Trump-appointed Judge Justin Walker. The appeals court noted that “the communications from former President Trump’s counsel” that Bannon had tried to rely on to defend his conduct did not purport “to authorize Bannon’s refusal to produce any documents or appear for his deposition.” The DC Circuit also rejected Bannon’s argument that the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection was improperly formed. “These objections suffer from a common defect,” the judges wrote. “Bannon did not raise them before the Select Committee and therefore forfeited them.” Bannon is one of two former members of Trump’s inner circle who faced prosecution for not participating in the House January 6 probe. The second, former Trump White House aidePeter Navarro, is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction. When the now-defunct House panel sought documents and testimony from Bannon in 2021, it pointed to alleged communications between Bannon and Trump in the days leading up to the January 6 Capitol attack, as well as comments Bannon made on his podcast the day before the riot that “all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.” Bannon for some time served in Trump’s White House, but by the time of Trump’s crusade to overturn his 2020 electoral loss, Bannon had long left the federal government.

politics,"Rep. Henry Cuellar’s former campaign manager and another political operative have agreed to plead guilty to federal crimes and are cooperating withthe Justice Department’s prosecution of the Texas Democrat, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday. Mina Colin Strother, Cuellar’s former campaign manager and former chief of staff, and Florencio “Lencho” Rendon, a political consultant and businessman from San Antonio, agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in March. Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, were indicted last week on suspicion of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities – a bank headquartered in Mexico City and an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan. Both the congressman and his wife have pleaded not guilty. Cuellar has publicly asserted his innocence, saying in a statement last week that “both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.” According to court documents, Rendon and Cuellar concocted the bribery scheme in 2015 after learning that the Mexican bank needed help doing business within the United States. Rendon signed on to a phony “consulting agreement” with the bank for $15,000 per month, prosecutors say. Most of the money was eventually sent to the Cuellars, prosecutors allege, but Rendon didn’t think it was a good idea to send money directly to Imelda. Cuellar then suggested recruiting Strother as a middleman, prosecutors say. The alleged plot evolved into an arrangement where Rendon would send $11,000 per month to Strother, who in turn would send $10,000 to a company owned by Imelda Cuellar, according to court documents. From March 2016 to February 2018, Strother transferred nearly $215,000 to Cuellar’s wife, according to court filings. The Cuellars are not named in Strother’s and Rendon’s plea deal agreements, but both of their case numbers are listed as related cases to Cuellar’s in court records. Specific details laid out in the plea agreements also exactly match details in the indictment against Cuellar. Cuellar’s attorney, Chris Flood, told CNN in a statement, “As long as Strother and Rendon tell the truth, we are not worried. As we all know, the government can convince people to tell them what they want to hear rather than the truth. I don’t know what they are saying, but as long as they stick to the truth, we are not worried.” CNN has reached out to attorneys for Rendon and Strother for comment.

Here are the takeaways from Day 14 of the Trumphush money trial: Daniels returned to the witness stand Thursday morning for a second day of cross examination, in which she combatively and defiantly responded to questions from Necheles and insisted her story about her sexual encounter with Trump was true. Trump has denied the affair. Trump’s attorney asked about inconsistencies in interviews Daniels has given about how her dinner with Trump was arranged, whether they had dinner and the notion that she felt threatened by Trump during the encounter. She noted that Daniels saw men and women naked regularly through her work in adult film movies – questioning why then, allegedly seeing Trump on his bed in boxers and a T-shirt “was so upsetting that you got light-headed, the blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted?” “If I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn’t expecting to see there, yeah,” Daniels responded. Necheles also asked how she described the encounter,pointing to a prior interview in which she said Trump told her “come here” and they started kissing on the bed. He did say “come here,” Daniels said in response. “You made all this up, right?” Necheles said. “No,” Daniels responded. Necheles continued again with the insinuation turning to Daniels’ work as a writer of adult films. “You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real,” Necheles asked. Wow,” Daniels saidwith a pause. “That’s not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real just like what happened to me in that room.” Beyond the details of the alleged encounter itself, Trump’s attorneys and prosecutors had Daniels tell conflicting accounts of her financial situation. Necheles continued to suggest that Daniels was making money off of saying she had sex with Trump, pointing to a tweet where she said she’d earned $1 million and otherswhere she directed her supporters to her online store after Trump was indicted. “You’re celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store,” Necheles asked. “Not unlike Mr. Trump,” Daniels responded. Trump’s attorney also questioned Daniels about her “Make America Horny Again” strip club tour in 2018 – showing posters she had promoted – and about the money she made through an NBC documentary, in which the filmmakers paid for the rights to her book. During re-direct, prosecutors had Daniels recount how telling her story has also cost her, from having to move her daughter and hire security to the lawyers’ fees she was ordered to pay after she sued Trump and lost. “On balance has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump been net positive or net negative in your life?” “Negative,” Daniels said. Former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout described the inner-workings of Trump’s West Wing, where she worked for more than two years sitting just outside the Oval Office. Westerhout  was asked about a list of Trump’s contacts she received from his longtime Trump Organization assistant Rhona Graff – a list that included everyone from television news personalities like Joe Scarborough and Jeanine Pirro (who was at the courthouse Thursday) to sports legends Serena Williams and Tom Brady. Eventually working at a desk with a direct line of sight to the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Westerhout explained how she learned Trump’s work habits. Trump liked sharpies, for instance, and printouts of documents. He preferred the Oxford comma. And the former president, she said, “liked speaking to people in person or on the phone.” Asked how many people Trump would typically speak to in a day, she couldn’t cite a specific number. “A lot,” Westerhout said. He would take calls as early as 6 a.m. and “late into the night” after she had gone to bed, she testified. The prosecution walked Westerhout through the checks she would receive from the Trump Org. in New York, in which she described bringing Trump a manilla envelope of checks each month to sign. She then sent them back to New York. Westerhout did not testify to direct knowledge of the checks that Trump signed to his former fixer Michael Cohen, which are cited in the charges that Trump falsified business records, but her story did add one more voice to the prosecution’s narrative that Trump was involved in signing of the checks in 2017. When asked to explain how she left the White House in 2019, Westerhout testified that she said some things she shouldn’t have and that she was “very regretful of my youthful indiscretion.” “I’ve grown a lot since then,” she said as she started crying. She was still sniffling as defense started cross examination, in which Necheles asked Westerhout about the book she wrote after leaving the White House, “Off the Record.” Westerhout said she “thought it was real important to share with the American people the man that I got to know.” “President Trump forgave you, right?” Necheles asked. “He did,” Westerhout said. “He was a really good boss.” Westerhout also offered jurors a contrast to Daniels’ account, testifying that Trump was close to his wife Melania and his family. The former president smiled as she described Melania Trump often texting her, “Madeline, it’s past dinner time. When is my husband coming home?” Trump’s lawyers asked Merchan both to declare a mistrial and modify the gag order against him after Daniels was off the stand. The judge rejected both requests. Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked for Trump to be allowed to publicly defend himself against Daniels’ allegations, arguing the former president currently is forced to stay silent in response to the suggestion that there was a non-consensual sexual encounter between her and Trump. Blanche argued that Daniels has changed her story by suggesting that this “completely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual.” Yet, Blanche said, “he is not allowed to say ‘I did not do that’” for voters who are seeing media coverage of the testimony. Merchan denied the request, saying he must protect the integrity of the proceedings and he doesn’t trust Trump not to violate an order if he were to modify it. “The reason why the gag order is in place to begin with is precisely because of the nature of these attacks, the vitriol,” Merchan said. “These were very real, very threatening attacks on potential witnesses.” “Your client’s track record speaks for itself here – I can’t take your word for it” that Trump will stick to disputing the facts, the judge also said. Merchan also denied Trump’s renewed motion for a mistrial over the salacious testimony Daniels gave that his attorneys say unfairly prejudices the jury against Trump. The judge said Trump’s outright denial of the incident and his legal team’s attack on her credibility opened the door for prosecutors to bring in Daniels’ testimony that turned salacious. “The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels’ story,” Merchan said. Merchan pointed the finger at Necheles who opted not to object to several salacious lines of questioning that the defense later used as reasons the judge should declare a mistrial. Blanche argued that Daniels’ testimony at trial was a new version of the alleged events – a point Merchan disagreed with. Prosecutor Josh Steinglass said Trump was aware of the “messy details” of the encounter in 2016 and that shows motive for the hush money payment and cover up. Blanche argued that the level of detail prosecutors elicited from Daniels went too far. But Merchan said “details like items in the bathroom, the weight of the furniture,” add a “sense of credibility if the jury chooses to believe them,” even as he acknowledged there were some details he would have preferred stayed out.

politics,"President Joe Biden’sdecision this week to make publichis ultimatum that amajor Israeli offensivein the city of Rafah would result in a shut-off of some US weapons did not come easily or lightly. It came after multiple rounds of phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, starting in mid-February, urging him to reconsider his plans to invade the densely populated city in southern Gaza that has been a critical conduit for humanitarian aid. Hours and hours of virtual and in-person meetings between Biden’s top national security lieutenants and their Israeli counterparts were intended to send the same message, according to officials: There are other ways to go after Hamas, Biden’s aides laid out, that stop short of invading a city where more than a million Palestinians have gone to seek safety, officials said. At multiple levels, the president and his team warned Netanyahu that a major invasion of Rafah wouldn’t be aided by American weapons. It was a message the White House believed was well understood bythe government in Israel,White House officials said Thursday. Still, making those warnings publicwas a step Biden had long been wary of taking. Doing so would amount to a turning point, and the biggest break in US-Israel ties since the start of the war in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas. Even under pressure from progressives in his own party to take steps to limit humanitarian suffering in Gaza, Biden has been careful to avoid an open rift with Netanyahu. Still, in Netanyahu’s war cabinet meetings, a decision to go into Rafah appeared imminent. The Israel Defense Forces have now established a presence in Rafah and along its border, choking off two aid entry points and warning of a larger offensive to come. Ultimately, officials said, Biden came to believe his warnings were going unheeded and so he changed course. Last week, Biden signed off on a pause of 3,500 bombs to Israel that administration officials feared would be dropped on Rafah. And on Wednesday, sitting at a community college in Wisconsin for an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Biden made explicit to the world what he said he’d already made obvious to Netanyahu in private. “If they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities – that deal with that problem,” Biden told Burnett. The president’s aides said the message shouldn’t have been a surprise to their intended recipients in Israel. “I can assure you the direct and forthright nature with which he expressed himself and his concerns in that interview with Erin Burnett is consistent with how he has expressed himself to Prime Minister Netanyahu and to Israeli officials,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday. The Israeli government, Kirby said, “has understood … for some time now” the implications a major Rafah offensive would have on the future of American arms shipments. Aware or not of the president’s views, Israeli officials reacted with shock to the public announcement. Netanyahu was defiant. “If we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. I have said that, if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails,” he said Thursday. Israeli officials also sought to downplay the significance of Biden’s announcement. A spokesman for the IDF, Daniel Hagari, said Israel already has the weapons it needs for the missions it is planning. In addition to 2,000-pound bombs, Biden told CNN that artillery could be held up in the event of a Rafah invasion. Despite being smaller in size than the bombs, the Biden administration views artillery as indiscriminate and imprecise weapons that can exact a dangerous toll in urban areas. Israel has claimed its current campaign in Rafah is “limited,” a description US officials have echoed. But behind the scenes, doubts linger about Israel’s intentions, CNN has learned, with limited clarity provided to the US on how it plans to proceed. Throughout the course of the conflict, Biden’s frustration with Netanyahu has grown, even as the US president maintained publicly that his support for the state of Israel was unwavering. Biden has made clear that no matter what course the Israel-Hamas war takes, the US would remain Israel’s most stalwart ally so long as he is president. That conviction, advisers said, was separate and apart from the evolution of the president’s relationship with Netanyahu. “Israel is not the same thing as Netanyahu,” a senior Biden adviser told CNN. Rafah has hardly been the only irritant in the relationship. In the telling of Biden’s close advisers, the IDF’s accidental killing in early April of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza – one of them an American citizen – broke the president’s already strained patience. Upon learning the news, Biden expressed fury, advisers said. He made clear to advisers that he saw the deaths of the aid workers as an unacceptable “breakdown” in some of the most fundamental ways in which he expected Israel to conduct its war, and that the moment required a new response. His team quickly arranged a phone call with Netanyahu. Several weeks prior, Biden had shared with friends on Capitol Hill – in comments that were caught on a hot mic – that he and the prime minister were likely headed towards some kind of rupture. He predicted the two leaders were due for a “come to Jesus” moment. Multiple advisers did not deny that Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu in April was, at the very least, as close to such a “come to Jesus” moment as the two leaders had had up until that point. In the brief call, Biden issued a new warning to Netanyahu: If Israel did not course-correct, the US would reconsider how it supports its ally in the conflict. It marked the clearest signal yet that six months into the war, Biden was starting to seriously consider conditioning US support for Israel. But even then, it was not known what exactly those consequences might look like, and what actions from Israel would ultimately push Biden over the edge. Since their call, the White House has praised Israel for taking steps to increase humanitarian aid, including opening additional crossings. Yet Rafah continued to shadow the relationship, as Israeli officials insisted on the necessity of going after Hamas in the city, even as Biden aides said they hadn’t seen a plan to protect civilians there. Meetings between the two sides failed to yield consensus on the issue, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials were unconvinced by Israel’s plans to protect civilians and made clear in public statements that an invasion of the city would amount to a humanitarian disaster. “The president and his team have been clear for several weeks that we do not support a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering with nowhere safe to go,” Kirby said on Thursday. “The president has said that publicly and he has communicated that repeatedly and straightforwardly to Prime Minister Netanyahu.” After Biden’s CNN interview, officials stressed the White House position on conditioning aid is a hypothetical one: The US would only pare back the equipment and weaponry provided to its longstanding ally if it launches the invasion of Rafah. That didn’t stop the president’s critics from accusing him of renouncing Israel, despite his clear statement that he wasn’t “walking away from Israel’s security.” Across the GOP spectrum, from former President Donald Trump to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, Biden’s political opponents likened the announcement to a message of an abandonment amid an ongoing war with terrorists. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who’d just survivedan ouster attempt, even suggested in an interview with Politico that Biden had a “senior moment” when he made the remark. Some Democrats also voiced criticism. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a staunch supporter of Israel, said that he disagreed with Biden’s plan to withhold some weapons shipments to Israel, warning the move “demonstrates to Hamas that they’re winning the PR war.” “I am concerned about that, and I don’t agree with the president,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. Sen. Jon Tester, a vulnerable Democrat from Montana, said, “I think he should release it” when asked about Biden’s handling of the weapons shipments. And Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said he was planning to speak with administration officials about the details of their plan later Thursday. “I’m trying to find out legally what they’re doing and the reasons for it,” he said. “So, until I’ve had a chance to talk to the administration, I’m going to defer making any specific comments.” Even though the president’s position amounted to his toughest public stance on Israel since the start of the war, it also appeared to do little to satisfy those in his own party who have agitated for an end to US support. “I think it’s a good step forward. I think we’ve got to do even more,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont democratic socialist, said on CNN, adding Biden’s warning about conditioning weapons “should have come a lot earlier.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/inside-bidens-public-ultimatum/index.html,CNN,Inside Biden’s decision to go public with his ultimatum to Israel over Rafah
politics,"Jack Quinn, former White House counsel and powerhouse Washington, DC, lawyer and influencer, passed away Wednesday at the age of 74. That is the obituary headline of a man who used his wonderful life to make a difference in American politics and public policy. A New York-born son of a power plant manager and a homemaker who was the first in his family to go to college, Quinn was ambitious and service-minded from the start. It was at the prestigious Georgetown University law school where Quinn got the political bug that led him to Capitol Hill, campaigns and eventually to the White House asPresident Bill Clinton’s counsel during the turbulent years of theWhitewater investigation. The powerbroker and top lobbyist in more recent years used his experience and know-how to represent family members of those killed in theSeptember 11, 2001, attacksinlawsuits alleging Saudi Arabia’s culpability. But the man I had the privilege of knowing was so much more. Outside of all that, I knew him as a friend; a husband who loved my dear friend Susanna, his wife of 17 years, with all of his heart; and a father who adored his eight children and 12 grandchildren. John Michael Quinn - “Jack” - was the kind of person who would send a text of encouragement out of the blue, greet you with his giant smile and a twinkle in his eye no matter how he was feeling and was always eager to show love and affection to his large family and friends. Looking back today at my texts from Jack, it was not uncommon to see “I love you” from him in the thread. But he was also someone who showed extreme kindness to people he barely knew. Jack was a CNN legal analyst for several years during the Trump administration, sharing his insights and vast expertise with our viewers on a regular basis. Elie Honig, now a senior CNN legal analyst, told me that he remembers being very new to television and meeting Jack in the green room. “I, of course, knew who Jack was, but he’d have no reason to know me aside from my first handful of on-air appearances. I hadn’t even met him in person yet, and he went to the effort of getting my email address and sending me a note welcoming me and saying I was doing a great job. I’ll always remember that gesture,” he told me, while noting that Jack was always “sunny” even when his health issues became more challenging. Those health issues, a lung disease that eventually took his life, made his CNN appearances harder and harder. But his impact is indelible. One of our talented makeup artists remarked to me when learning of Jack’s passing how kind and solicitous he always was - no matter the time or the circumstance, which is not always the case in the stressful and unpredictable world of cable news. Jack’s youngest son, Storm, and my son are about a year apart and became friends as babies. Watching Jack interact with his miracle boy was something to behold – the amount of love knew no bounds – nevermind that his DNA is so strong that Storm, much like Jack’s other children, resembles him so much that it was almost eerie. The mark that Jack made on this world is far greater than his titles, far deeper than his jobs and far more impressive than his political influence. He was a man of character, compassion and good humor, and I am one of countless people who feel blessed to have had him in my life. May his memory be a blessing.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/jack-quinn-died-white-house-counsel/index.html,CNN,"Remembering Jack Quinn, former White House counsel but more importantly a good man"
politics,"The Senate voted on Thursdayto pass a major federal aviation bill ahead of a key Friday deadline. The bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill would renew authority for the agency for the next five years and aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. The House will next need to pass the legislation. The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislationseeks to addressthe nation’s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring, includes strengthened consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays, and would implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions. Although there is broad bipartisan support for the legislation, the package touched off contentious debate over some of its provisions. One flashpoint centered aroundflights at Reagan National Airportjust outside of Washington, DC – with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package. Ultimately, however, there were no votes on amendments. Some lawmakers argue that adding flights will give consumers more choices and bring down prices, while others say it would increase congestion and delays at the airport. The House voted on Wednesday to pass a one-week extension for federal aviation programs, a stopgap move intended to head off alooming end-of-week deadline.Congress is up against a Friday deadline to reauthorize FAA authorities. This will move that deadline to next Friday, May 17.

politics,"Judge Juan Merchan called out former President Donald Trump’s defense team during their motion for a mistrial Thursday afternoon, telling them there were many times they could have objected to Stormy Daniels’ testimony, but did not. For the second time this week, Merchan expressed surprise that Trump’s lawyers had not objected more when Daniels was on the stand. And for the second time this week, Merchan rejected their motion for a mistrial. Trump attorney Todd Blanche argued Daniels’ changed her story by suggesting that this “completely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual” and said the defense did not know those questions were coming, hearing them for the first time on Tuesday. The judge responded to their arguments saying, “For some unexplained reason that I still don’t understand” there was no objection to certain testimony cited in the motion for a mistrial and again today. Merchan specifically pointed to Daniels’ testimony about the trailer park, in which Daniels suggested Trump told her she would be stuck living in a trailer park before they had sex in 2006. The judge said he felt that was unnecessary and he objected himself. Another example listed by Merchan was the testimony about Trump not wearing a condom. Merchan said he was surprised attorney Susan Necheles did not object. “Why on earth she (Necheles) wouldn’t object to the mention of a condom I don’t understand,” Merchan said. Daniels testified on Tuesday that Trump did not wear a condom when they had sex and described telling Trump during their conversation at the hotel dining room table her sexual partners during filming of her movies always wore a condom. Merchan also referred back to the defense’s opening statement when Blanche denied there was ever a sexual encounter between Daniels and Trump. The judge said that assertion opened the door for the prosecution to make an effort to show her story was credible to prove their case, allowing them to ask more detailed questions about the encounter. “The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels’ story,” Merchan said.

politics,"US intelligence officials are watching closely to see if theUnited States’ support for Ukrainewill lead the Russian government to take more risks in potentially interfering in the 2024 presidential election, a senior FBI official told reporters Thursday. FBI officials are concerned that thewar in Ukraine– andPresident Joe Biden’s reliable backing of Kyiv – might be an “animating event for the Russians,” the FBI official said at a briefing with reporters about election security efforts. “We’re certainly… keeping our eye out to make sure that that’s not increasing [their] risk taking.” The FBI briefed reporters on the condition that the senior FBI officials not be named. Related articleRussia sees window of opportunity to expand attacks as Ukraine awaits further US aid, officials say A clear divide has emerged in US politics, with Democrats largely backing Biden’s financial and military support for Ukraine, and some leading Republicans, includingformer President Donald Trumpandcongressional GOP hardliners, increasingly backing away from the foreign aid. US officials are concerned that, withUS military aid to Ukrainepotentially on the line in the November election, Russia could be motivated to more aggressively meddle in the 2024 election than it did in 2020. But US officials have not publicly identified any examples of that happening yet. In the 2020 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to denigrate Biden, support Trump and undermine confidence in the US electoral process, according to a declassifiedUS intelligence report. But Russia’s actions in 2020 weren’t as brazen or far-reaching as itshack-and-leak operationsto help Trump and undermine Hillary Clinton’s candidacy in 2016, according to US intelligence agencies. The FBI official’s comments on Thursday echo those made by a senior National Security Agency official in March. “I think where we diverge in this election cycle is Russia is very motivated to make sure that that the focus on support to Ukraine is disrupted,” Rob Joyce, who headed NSA’s Cybersecurity Directorate before retiring in late March, told reporters. “I think you’ll see the themes of their activities all pushed through a lens of what is going to erode support for Ukraine.” Asked by CNN if that makes Russia more likely to interfere in the 2024 US elections compared to 2020, Joyce said: “I don’t know that it makes them more likely, but it does make them dangerous.” During Thursday’s FBI press briefing, a second senior FBI official said that Russia likely viewsUS election infrastructure, including state and local government networks, as “legitimate targets” for cyber-espionage and data collection. “Russia can use their access to those government networks to undermine confidence in the US election integrity and bolster influence operations,” the second FBI official said. The FBI officials also singled out China and Iran as other governments that could be willing to interfere in or influence the 2024 US election. In the 2020 election, Chinaconsideredconducting influence operations aimed at changing the outcome of the election but chose not to, according to theUS intelligence report. Iran, meanwhile, conducted a “multipronged covert influence campaign” aimed at hurting Trump’s election bid, the report said. Artificial intelligence, the first FBI official said, increases the ability of sophisticated state actors “to scale their operations and … really build them out larger than we’ve seen previously.” CNN’s Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/fbi-concern-ukraine-russia-2024-election/index.html,CNN,FBI watching if US support for Ukraine will spur Russian risk taking in 2024 election
politics,"Desperately needed humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza will at least for the next few days remain sitting off the coast of Gaza on an American Navy cargo ship, as the US continues to face obstacles to getting thefloating pier it has constructedin place and operational in the eastern Mediterranean. The pier and causeway, known as Joint Logistics Over the Shore or JLOTS, will ultimately be used by the US, its allies and aid groups to get aid into Gaza by sea from Cyprus. But the system had to be moved to the Port of Ashdod last week due to heavy seas, and it still hasn’t left. Even when JLOTS becomes operational, the weather and sea conditions may severely limit the ability to use the floating pier. It can only be safely operated in conditions with a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour, according to a 2006 Naval War College paper on the systems limitations. A prediction of sea conditions fromIsrael’s Marine Data Centershows waves are often at or near that 3-foot limit in the area. “JLOTS operations, which must take both safety and throughput requirements into account, must often wait for favorable weather and sea state conditions,” the authors wrote. A defense official confirmed to CNN that the limitations on the pier system are accurate. “The bottom line – heavy seas do have an effect on the ability to execute the JLOTS mission,” the official said. If winds or waves are stronger, loading and unloading using the JLOTS pier becomes dangerous. Another potentially complicating factor is how Israel decides to proceed with its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza, US officials said. A major Israeli offensive there could raise additional security concerns and impact the timing of when the pier and causeway are staged in the eastern Mediterranean. The planned staging area for the aid once it reaches Gaza has been hit by mortar and rocket fire at least twice in the last several weeks, CNN has reported. The US is still aiming to move the system into place and begin the operation “in the coming days,” a Pentagon spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. For now, a massive barge called the M/V Sagamore that will be used to deliver the initial pallets of humanitarian aid from Cyprus to the pier has begun to move the supplies to another ship currently off the coast of Gaza, called the M/V Roy P. Benavidez. The Benavidez, contracted by the US military, has been in the eastern Mediterranean since last month supporting the maritime corridor effort. The US is also still working to finalize plans about who will actually transport humanitarian aid from the pier to the shore in Gaza, according to multiple US officials familiar with the matter. The UK had initially offered to provide personnel to help drive aid trucks from the US military-built causeway off the coast of Gaza to the shore, where it would be picked up by UN personnel overseen by the World Food Programme, officials said. But the British recently withdrew that offer amid security concerns, the sources said. The US, meanwhile, has ruled out using its own troops to drive the aid to the beach, because the Biden administration does not want American personnel getting that close to Gaza, officials have said. A UK government spokesperson said that the UK does not “currently have plans to deploy Armed Forces personnel onto Gazan soil as part of this initiative, but we are working closely with the US, Cyprus, and other allies to ensure aid can be quickly delivered over the pier once it is fully installed.” Another diplomatic source familiar with the discussions confirmed that there had been conversations in which the UK had offered to drive the aid down the causeway to the pier, as part of “a host of contingency plans” that had been developed. “But for now there are no plans for the UK to be involved in that way,” the source added “The most likely scenario is an as yet undecided third party.” Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday that “non-US civilian contractors will be driving those vehicles on the causeway onto the beach.” One plan being discussed is for Israeli contractors to transport the aid, the officials and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. But that could also change and is not finalized, despite the Pentagon predicting that the pier will be up and running in the next several days. The Israel Defense Forces have agreed to provide a wide security perimeter around the pier system and the aid operation. That has made some humanitarian groups and UN officials uneasy given the IDF’s history of targeting aid convoys and the perception that they are working under the IDF’s control, CNN previously reported. But the plan is for the IDF to remain at a relative distance as the aid is transported and offloaded onto the beach in Gaza, officials told CNN.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/us-gaza-pier-obstacles/index.html,CNN,US facing obstacles getting aid delivered to Gaza after finishing pier construction
politics,"Hunter Biden’s latest attempts to throw out his federal gun case were rejected in back-to-back rulings Thursday, teeing up a high-stakes criminal trial next month in Delaware. The president’s son had asked the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss the charges by overturningprior decisionsfrom the trial judge that let the case move forward. But the appellate panel instead rejected Hunter Biden’s appeals, which related to his defunct plea deal and his claims that the case was tainted by political bias. Hours later, the trial judge, Maryellen Noreika, rejected Hunter Biden’s remaining motion to dismiss the case based on Second Amendment grounds. The rulings pave the way for the first-ever trial against the child of a sitting US president. They’re also a victory for special counsel David Weiss, who is prosecuting Hunter Biden in two separate criminal cases and is fending off aggressive pushback from his lawyers. With the gun case intact, Hunter Biden now faces a legally and politically perilous summer, with back-to-back trials while his father focuses on the 2024 campaign. The gun trial is slated to begin in early June unless the parties reach a plea deal or some other agreement to resolve the case, which is always possible. A separate tax trial is scheduled to begin in late June. “In reviewing the panel’s decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,” Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement about the appeals court ruling, suggesting that he may ask the full Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit to rehear the appeal. Prosecutors claim Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, whichviolated federal lawbecause he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts. His attorneys have argued that the charges trample his Second Amendment rights and that “possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety.” Noreika, a Trump appointee who was confirmed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate, refused to dismiss the gun indictment last month. She also previously presided over Hunter Biden’sbotched plea deal hearinglast summer. Hunter Biden is also facing afederal tax indictment, and that trial is slated to begin in late June in California. He has pleaded not guilty to all nine charges in that case, which revolves around millions of dollars he made in Ukraine, in China and through other overseas deals. Weiss’ team successfully argued that the appellate court didn’t have jurisdiction to review whether Noreika made any mistakes earlier this year while rejecting Hunter Biden’s motions to dismiss the gun case. “This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court’s orders are appealable before final judgment,” the three-judge appellate panel wrote in a four-page ruling. They turned away his attempts to review lower-court decisions about the legality of Weiss’ appointment and whether last year’s botched plea deal – which would’ve resolved the case – was still active. In rejecting his appeal Thursday, the 3rd Circuit panel said those types of deals with prosecutors “do not implicate a right not to be tried” and wouldn’t give Hunter Biden additional avenues to pursue appeals. The decision was unanimous and based on procedural grounds. The three-judge panel included one Republican appointee and two Democratic appointees, including Judge Cindy Chung, who was put on the bench by President Joe Biden. Further, the ruling could make it harder for Hunter Biden to appeal his loss in the Second Amendment challenge, which Noreika rejected Thursday. Hunter Biden’s attorneys argued the three gun charges should be tossed out because the firearm-possession statute used against him violated the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. The specific statutes involved in the case make it a crime to lie on federal firearm forms about using illicit drugs, and also make it illegal to own a gun while using those drugs. Hunter Biden’s attorneys, citing arecent decision from the 5th Circuit– which does not cover the state of Delaware, where he was charged – argued that under the Second Amendment, an individual “can no longer be denied gun ownership due simply to past drug use.” But the trial judge disagreed in her ruling Thursday. “The current state of the law on the facial constitutionality of (the statute) is decidedly not in Defendant’s favor,” Noreika wrote. “No appellate court has agreed with his position, and possibly only one district court has found (the statute) unconstitutional on its face. This Court ultimately sides with the great majority of cases upholding the facial constitutionality of (the statute).” In the 5th Circuit case, US v. Daniels, the conservative-leaning appeals court said the federal gun law that prohibits users of illegal drugs from possessing firearms was unconstitutional. In reaching that conclusion, the appeals court cited a landmark 2022 Supreme Court decision thatchanges the framework that lower courts must usewhen analyzing gun restrictions. Prosecutors handling Hunter Biden’s case have called the 5th Circuit decision “mistaken.” They also noted Hunter Biden’s own admission to using illicit drugs while he allegedly purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018. Noreika on Thursday also rejected an attempt by Hunter Biden to obtain internal Justice Department documents that could shed light on any attempts by former President Donald Trump and his appointees to interfere with the long-running criminal investigation. As part of an effort to find evidence that Hunter Biden was being politically targeted, his attorneys asked for any documents about him that involved Trump, former Attorney General Bill Barr, other top Justice Department officials or several US attorneys. But the judge turned down that request Thursday. Shepreviously rebuffedHunter Biden’s bid to throw out the case because of the supposed politicization, noting that even though Trump did call for Hunter Biden’s prosecution while he was president, the charges were filed under President Joe Biden’s watch and with oversight from Biden’s appointees. “Defendant has failed to show how any of the requested communications among former DOJ and Executive Branch officials could constitute exculpatory evidence as applied to him and the three firearm-related offenses being pursued here,” Noreika wrote Thursday.
