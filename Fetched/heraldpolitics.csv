President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has exposed 11 cases of fake doctors this year alone, as people take advantage of the vastness of the country’s largest referral medical institution to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,Prof Munjeri gets State-assisted funeral

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and business organisations will be held during the business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

The late national hero and leader of the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa (ZAOGA), Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, was a visionary leader who valued the empowerment of children through education, Information and Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingimuzi Phuti said this week.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Ezekiel Guti Christian Primary School in Riverside, Chitungwiza, after touring the school as part of preparations for the Ezekiel Guti Day to be commemorated on Saturday, he said: “I am humbled by the vision of our departed hero, Baba Guti, the vision that put the concerns of a human being to reality, the vision that foresaw things that we are beginning to discover today, the importance of taking a child to school, the knowledge that it doesn’t have to be the responsibility of Government alone.

“It’s the responsibility that is more entangled with care and understanding the reason to empower somebody through education that drove him. But apart from that we are really touched by the ahead of time kind of man he was,” he said.

Deputy Minister Phuti said the programme was meant to celebrate the life of an illustrious son of Zimbabwe whose visionary leadership was noticeable not only in Zimbabwe alone but impacted lives around the world.

The ministry has partnered the Ezekiel Guti Primary School to train youths in the use of ICT.

“In honour of the legacy of Baba Guti we decided that we come in with our digital relevance hence that training we have organised in partnership with your administration.

“We hope that the training will not only open up the eyes of our youngsters but will motivate them to pursue other relevant skills from this,” he said.

Archbishop Guti’s widow, Apostle Eunor Guti expressed her gratitude to the Ministry for the partnership.

“I would like to thank the Ministry of ICT for partnering with us and joining the Zaoga family as we celebrate the life and legacy of our father, Professor Guti,” she said.

Politics,"May Day may be a fairly quiet holiday but it is a very important one as it concentrates minds on the position of workers within the economy and the need to ensure that their contribution is recognised.

Their rights and expectations are also taken into account.

President Mnangagwa set the tone with his statement on the eve of the public holiday, that the workers are an essential part of the economic growth through their production and productivity, and their importance cannot be minimised. Without the workers there is no production and they are entitled to their fair share of the wealth their efforts produce.

The Government is the largest employer, and runs almost all the essential services that the rest of us need to produce and to work, so as Head of Government he renewed his commitment that conditions of service will be continually improved within the State sector.

There are obvious limits to just how fast remuneration can be raised and the non-monetary benefits can be implemented and increased. We are not going to print money, or even borrow money, to pay civil servants more since that just leads to economic challenges.

But as the economy grows the tax revenue grows and so more can be done each year to improve the conditions of State workers. The Government, within its fiscal discipline that is now so essential, has maintained the percentage of revenue spent on staff, and maintained it as the largest item in the budget, so economic growth automatically means more can be spent.

The commitment by the President not to take State workers for granted and to maintain the policy of continual improvement as the economy grows is, therefore, important. He recognises their essential input and he wants to treat them fairly.

The President also made his appeal to the private sector, which employs considerably more people than the State, even with the growth of self-employment, to again follow a similar policy of continual improvement and making sure that workers are treated fairly and get their fair share of the wealth being created. Again this is the result of a growing economy, growing production and growing investment.

A major plank of President Mnangagwa’s policy is the Vision 2030, pushing Zimbabwe upwards into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. That is not just a mantra, since we have to think about what that journey means.

The only way to have a successful and continuous increase in national wealth is to make sure that everyone benefits.

That in turn increases growth. Even the arch-capitalist Henry Ford grabbed that point early on as he introduced mass production of motor cars. He worked out that he was not going to succeed unless his own very large workforce could afford to buy the cars they made, so he raised wages and was able to pay these through the higher productivity his assembly lines generated as well as the growing stream of revenue from his growing sales. Everything worked together.

The growing number of the self-employed win as well when employers are fair. Those civil servants and private-sector workers spend the money they earn, and spend quite a lot of it on the goods and services that the self-employed provide. So they win and the whole nation together moves forward. In any case, the small businesses become larger and start hiring people, so they need to remember that they must pay their new workers their just dues.

The Government follows this policy by using the small-scale farming sectors to drive rural development. The whole policy is based on the premise that converting subsistence farmers into small commercial farmers creates the wealth that drives rural industrialisation and the growing percentage of rural dwellers who provide the goods and services that the farmers require and want.

In a developed economy a huge majority of rural dwellers are not farmers, but the underlying rural economy is based on farm production, so the Second Republic rural development policy is based on fact and functional theory, not on some pipedream. Vision 2030 is based on the need for the people, as well as the national economy, to be upper middle income.

While the Second Republic has streamlined labour law, to make it easier to understand and implement, it has retained the essential core that workers and employees are human beings who have rights, as well as duties, and has retained the whole gamut of the national employment councils and workers committees that have been so effective in ensuring that employers and employees can negotiate properly and equally. It has strengthened the similar system in State service, so there is a joint negotiating forum.

The national employment councils were created in settler days to benefit the white workers. They were partially extended under the more liberal settler regime of the late 1950s to more of the formal sector, but only started flourishing fully after independence when everyone was included fully in spirit as well as law.

But they need to be used. Some sectors have very strong and effective NECs and not only do employees benefit, but employers have found that they also benefit by having agreements that work and so can be factored into operations. So they make sure that proper and accurate data is available and enforce the NEC decisions.

Some sectors have very weak NECs, the commercial workers especially, and both employers and employees need to upgrade these.  Sometimes past splits give rise to the oddity that workers in the same sector, and even under the same employer, fall under different NECs. Combining them so that the strongest and best represents all workers in a sector makes sense, for both sides.

Labour law is there to create the practical conditions that President Mnangagwa spoke so strongly about, the need for employers and employees to be fair, and for workers to receive their just share of the growing wealth and basically to ensure that workers who fulfil their duties conscientiously are not treated as cogs in a machine but as co-creators of that extra wealth.",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-drivers-of-the-economy-need-recognition-fair-remuneration/,The Herald,

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,Prof Munjeri gets State-assisted funeral

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and business organisations will be held during the business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

The late national hero and leader of the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa (ZAOGA), Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, was a visionary leader who valued the empowerment of children through education, Information and Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingimuzi Phuti said this week.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Ezekiel Guti Christian Primary School in Riverside, Chitungwiza, after touring the school as part of preparations for the Ezekiel Guti Day to be commemorated on Saturday, he said: “I am humbled by the vision of our departed hero, Baba Guti, the vision that put the concerns of a human being to reality, the vision that foresaw things that we are beginning to discover today, the importance of taking a child to school, the knowledge that it doesn’t have to be the responsibility of Government alone.

“It’s the responsibility that is more entangled with care and understanding the reason to empower somebody through education that drove him. But apart from that we are really touched by the ahead of time kind of man he was,” he said.

Deputy Minister Phuti said the programme was meant to celebrate the life of an illustrious son of Zimbabwe whose visionary leadership was noticeable not only in Zimbabwe alone but impacted lives around the world.

The ministry has partnered the Ezekiel Guti Primary School to train youths in the use of ICT.

“In honour of the legacy of Baba Guti we decided that we come in with our digital relevance hence that training we have organised in partnership with your administration.

“We hope that the training will not only open up the eyes of our youngsters but will motivate them to pursue other relevant skills from this,” he said.

Archbishop Guti’s widow, Apostle Eunor Guti expressed her gratitude to the Ministry for the partnership.

“I would like to thank the Ministry of ICT for partnering with us and joining the Zaoga family as we celebrate the life and legacy of our father, Professor Guti,” she said.

IRAN has offered 1 000 educational scholarships for Zimbabweans with the first batch of students, likely to be lecturers from polytechnics and industrial colleges, undergoing six-month courses as trainers of trainers, set to start their studies before year end.

The beneficiaries and areas of study will be informed by the need to bridge the human resources gap identified by the Government initiated skills gap audit of 2018.

The offer comes after Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga recently led Zimbabwe’s participation at the second Iran-Africa International Economic Conference.

Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Permanent Secretary Professor Fanuel Tagwira said the programme would target staff from the polytechnics and industrial colleges.

“We believe in action. We believe in implementation and we have learnt a lot since coming here. Clearly there are a number of things that have happened. With the partnership we now have with Iran, they have offered us 1 000 scholarships for our education.

“We sat down and went through their training centre and we saw what they are providing and as we go home, we are going to mobilise so that we can send the first batch of our teachers who are in polytechnics and industrial colleges to come here and acquire skills for a period of six months then they will become trainers.

“This is a training of trainers and for each discipline, we will send a batch of 12 people to make a full class so that they can teach them in English and they will acquire the skills and after six months they go back and train others, said Prof Tagwira.

The programme was ready to roll out and the two parties had agreed on the implementation modalities and timelines.

“We have met with their ministry of science and technology and innovation and as we discussed with them, we already have a memorandum of understanding with them and they are saying let’s move. Our first step is establishing a steering committee that will be responsible for agreeing on the programmes that we want to work on.”

The Iranians had expressed a desire for Zimbabwe to benefit from expertise in the area of science and technology.

The Iranians wanted to know what technology was required to move the nation forward and then to work together to make sure that knowledge was available in Zimbabwe.

Iran boasts some of the most advanced technologies in the world and has a vibrant manufacturing sector that has kept its economy afloat despite operating under the weight of illegal economic sanctions for close to 45 years.

The Ministry of Information, Publicity, and Broadcasting Services has come up with a communication plan to aid the Reserve Bank in raising awareness of the new gold-backed ZiG currency introduced last month.

While the ZiG existed from the second week of last month in bank accounts and electronic transfers, notes and coins of the ZiG were released to the market on Tuesday, bringing relief to the transacting public who were facing difficulties in accessing small change.

In a statement yesterday Permanent Secretary for Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Mr Nick Mangwana said the Ministry was using communication channels, such as radio, television, newspapers, and social media, to educate the public about the advantages of using gold as a currency, such as its stability and value retention.

“To achieve this mandate, the ministry is using its spread of district information officers and provincial information officers to reach the citizens in rural and urban areas.

“In addition to the Ministry’s information ecosystem, it is also working with key stakeholders, such as financial institutions and businesses, to encourage the adoption of gold as a means of exchange.

“Additionally, the ministry will be coordinating events, such as workshops and conferences, to engage with the public and address any concerns or misconceptions about using gold as a currency.

“By effectively communicating the benefits and possibilities of using gold as a currency, the Ministry of Information, Publicity, and Broadcasting Services will help generate support and momentum for the gold currency publicity campaign in Zimbabwe,” he said.

Mr Mangwana said the communication plan sought to ensure that the purpose, benefits, and features of the new currency were clearly understood by the target audience.

The communication plan was helping the team to undertake five key issues: creating awareness, providing information, addressing concerns, building trust and encouraging adoption.

“The communication plan will be instrumental in creating awareness among the citizens about the introduction of the ZiG. Through various communication channels such as media, social media, and public events, the plan will ensure that the citizens are informed about the new currency and its benefits.

“The communication plan is providing detailed information about the Zimbabwe Gold currency, including how it works, its value, and how citizens can exchange their existing currency for the new currency. This will help to dispel any confusion or misinformation surrounding the new currency.

“The communication plan is addressing any concerns or questions that citizens may have about the introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold currency. By providing clear and accurate information, the plan will help to alleviate any doubts or fears that the citizens may have,” he said.

“Effective communication is crucial in building trust between the Government and the citizens. The communication plan ensures transparency and openness in the communication process, which helps to build trust and confidence in the new currency.

“The communication plan is aiming to encourage citizens to adopt the Zimbabwe Gold Currency and use it in their daily transactions. By highlighting the benefits of the new currency, such as stability and security, the plan will incentivise citizens to embrace the new currency.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/ministry-partners-rbz-in-currency-awareness/,The Herald,Ministry partners RBZ in currency awareness

Government has intensified the fight against livestock mortality by constructing water troughs at the village business units, hay baling, and drought mitigation awareness campaigns.

It has also embarked on a nationwide borehole drilling exercise to save the lives of both livestock and people.

The Government is also upscaling hay baling programmes, where five million hay bales are expected to be produced this season and water is also distributed in areas where livestock is most vulnerable.

To date, private players and the Government have so far produced 1 223 674 hay bales and last season a total of 4 803 133 hay bales were produced.

The Agriculture and Rural Development Advisory Service (ARDAS)indicates that the Government is constructing troughs at borehole sites adding that it is currently mobilising water bowsers for strategic areas.

“Drought mitigation awareness campaigns are underway. This involves the use of pamphlets, use of electronic and print media.

“Drilling of boreholes is underway and piping of water from dams to strategic areas is recommended.

“Modalities for expediting the procurement process of the requirements for hay baling are underway. In the previous hay bailing of 2023, a total of 4,8 million were produced and these need to be mobilised as a strategic supplementary feeding,” said the department.

Farmers are encouraged to destock. This involves reducing the number of animal stock during the drought. Non-productive stock is selected, finished off, and sold, and the returns can be used to purchase feed to save the productive herd.

Destocking reduces the demand for fodder & grazing.

Disposal and removal of diseased animals will reduce the potential for environmental and health challenges.

Destocking also helps create links with traders in remote areas, where they may not naturally have reached.

Financing of traders to support destocking is also important and facilitation of increased offtake through removal of trade and marketing barriers.

Livestock vaccinations are also recommended this period to mitigate the spread of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) during movement of livestock from FMD zones into national parks.

Grazing of livestock too close to the ground and indiscriminate feeding patterns common during drought periods will expose them to diseases such as Anthrax, Blackleg, Botulism, and Hardware disease.

Increased activity at the human-livestock-wildlife interface will likely result in rabies virus spill-over to humans and domestic animals hence the need to vaccinate against these diseases

Farmers are encouraged to implement management practices such as providing ample shade and access to cool water, and adjusting feeding schedules can help minimise the impact of heat on cattle health and welfare.

They are also encouraged to establish dedicated fodder plots and provide cattle with adequate water.

Farmers are urged to downscale some livestock and procure feed adding that there is a need to practice good husbandry practises.

Acting chief director at the Veterinary Services Department Dr Pious Makaya said livestock condition is not bad adding that borehole drilling and hay bailing are critical components that need to be scaled up this period.

“Grazing is limited in winter due to the effects of climate change so various strategies were put in place by the Government to ensure that our livestock do not suffer from drought,” he said.

Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union (ZCFU) president Dr Shadreck Makombe said farmers should consider the long-term sustainability of the pasture and not exceed its carrying capacity.

There is a need to reduce the stocking rate by either selling less productive animals or moving them to alternative grazing areas.

The situation will reduce pressure on the pasture and ensure that there is enough forage for the remaining animals, he said.

Recently, Livestock Farmers Union chairman Sifiso Sibanda said farmers may need to safeguard their livestock this coming season by adjusting herd sizes and stocking rates to prevent overgrazing and reduce the risk of livestock losses due to feed shortages.

ENNISMORE, a creative hospitality company which operates the Mondrian Hotels brand across the world, is looking into establishing a five-star hotel in Zimbabwe as part of its expansion drive into the African continent.

With properties in Cannes, Mexico City, Ibiza, Florida, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Doha, Seoul, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shoreditch London, the brand is on track to establish its footprint in Zimbabwe.

Mondrian Hotels and Residences is part of Ennismore, a creative hospitality company rooted in culture and community, with a global collective of entrepreneurial and founder-built brands with purpose at their heart.

Formed in 2021, Ennismore is a joint venture with Accor, which holds a majority shareholding.

In an interview at Mondrian Seoul Itaewon, general manager Mr Damien Marchenay said as a global leader in the hotel industry, they were planning on expanding to Zimbabwe.

“The Mondrian Brand was born 30 years ago in Los Angeles, United States from one guy called Jan Schager and he loved Mondrian as a painter,” he said.

“He then created the brand from this painting (Mondrian) so a lot of colourful, lot of animations and then we translate it here in Seoul as a lot of K-pop. Mondrian became a wonderful brand that could be expanded everywhere and we hope in Africa and we hope in Zimbabwe.

“We look for partners everywhere in the world and then we think that a lot of different countries will fit very well in the brand.

“Definitely Zimbabwe will be one because this is a country where you have got a lot of different things that you can bring to the brand tourism, but not only tourism, economic growth and everything.”

Mr Marchenay said it will be good to get a Mondrian in Zimbabwe as part of their expansion drive to Africa.

Online sites allowing hate speech and cyberbullying will be put out of reach, the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) has promised as it will soon lead an uncompromising fight against serious perpetrators of these menaces.

Director general of Potraz Dr Gift Machengete told participants recently at the launch of findings of a Child Online Safety Survey carried out by Potraz, in collaboration with Research Council of Zimbabwe and the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, that peddling hate speech and cyberbullying now warranted special attention as it was now rife.

“Cyberbullying and hate speech is quite rampant these days on X (formerly Twitter). Cyberbullying on X is now unbearable. It cannot be allowed to continue.

“At the regulatory level, as Potraz, we are doing something about this. We are worried about the safety of our children online. We will make sure that these illicit sites are out of reach. We are supposed to use the internet productively,” he said.

“The sites are going to be out of reach so that we control the content. We will be taking action under the Data Protection Act. We now have the technology to hunt for those who use pseudo names peddling sexual content, cyber bullying and hate speech. We want to put a stop on hate speech and cyber bullying.”

In 2021, Zimbabwe enacted a cyber and data protection law to protect citizens” privacy and curb internet abuse.

Potraz is mandated to set up and enforcing the rules for data collection, protection, storage and presentation.

The Cyber and Data Protection Act ensures that individuals have better control over their personal information and that this information is processed for a legitimate purpose and in a lawful, fair and transparent manner.

Potraz now has a telecommunications traffic monitoring system to track mobile phone traffic in real-time to monitor the revenue operators generate.

Technology experts say cyberbullying has become a prevalent issue within Zimbabwe and the African digital space with many users being bullied because of their opinions, facial looks and associations.

They say cyberbullying leads to depression, infringement on freedom of expression and association, loss of self-esteem and death on some occasions.

One in three young people in 30 countries said they have been a victim of online bullying, with one in five reporting having skipped school due to cyberbullying and violence, according to a 2019 Unicef poll.

The growing use of digital technologies has led to the rise of cyberbullying, the deluge of racist posts on X and the pervasive atmosphere of social hatred.

THE Government’s completion of a staff village comprising 220 houses for civil servants and other State employees assigned to the Beitbridge Border Post has boosted staff morale, resulting in improved border efficiency.

Staff from agencies such as the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra), the Department of Immigration as well as Government ministries and security arms have taken occupancy of the houses.

Zimborders Consortium, in partnership with the Government, built the staff village some 7km east of the border town under a 17 and half year public private partnership.

In addition, 28 more F14 houses were allocated in the north of the town to civil servants.

“We commend this milestone move by our Government to address accommodation challenges for its workers. The completion of this project has accommodated those that were exposed to high rentals by landlords, usually paying in South African rands),” said the District Development Coordinator, Mrs Sikhangezile Mafu-Moyo.

“The new staff village has reduced congestion for those that were sharing the few available houses with their workmates.

“Morale of the workers has improved and this is translating to improved service delivery at the same time ensuring the full implementation of the various Government policies and obligations.”

The new staff village has 20 Type A houses for heads of departments with three bedrooms detached units and (Type B) 20 others with three bedrooms and are semi-detached.

The remaining (Type C) 180 units are high-rise flats with two bedrooms which are being shared by a total of 180 junior staff members.

The houses were built in the form of a gated complex with an independent sewer system comprising a bio-digester.

In addition, the housing complex has a clubhouse with a swimming pool, braai area, and numerous playing areas for children among other social amenities.

“On the development side, the staff village has improved the quality of infrastructure in our district. It also reduced the national housing waiting list and reduced pressure from civil servants inquiring about accommodation,” said Mrs Mafu-Moyo.

Regional immigration officer in-charge of Beitbridge, Mr Joshua Chibundu said the availability of more housing units had enabled the department to deploy adequate workers to clear traffic through the three border terminals for freight, buses and the one handling light cars and pedestrians.

“The housing project has brought joy to the officers who were previously sharing accommodation, depriving them of the much needed rest after a day’s hard work,” said Mr Chibundu.

“We recently received additional manpower and the houses brought us much relief because we were not going to accommodate them if the village had not been opened for occupation. We now have a full complement of officers deployed at Beitbridge”.

THE Zimbabwe Union of Journalists wants a single National Employment Council (NEC) for the whole media industry to address working conditions of all journalists.

At present newspaper journalists fall under a NEC that includes all other staff in the newspaper, printing and packaging industry and was an extension of the former NEC that represented printers, taking over from the NEC for the Commercial Undertaking of Zimbabwe responsible for journalists and commercial staff.

In a statement to mark Workers Day that is observed on May 1 annually, ZUJ president Mr George Maponga bemoaned working conditions for journalists, which he said do not compare with other sectors whose remuneration is sustainable.

“We are celebrating Workers Day at a time when the situation is not all rosy in the media industry.

“The role of the media is to educate, entertain and inform and we are exalting Government to expeditiously put in place a National Employment Council for the media industry, which will put in place a lasting solution to the poor salaries and working conditions that have condemned journalists to poverty,” he said.

“Today, we join the rest of the world in marking Workers Day when our tails are down because we have nothing to show for our toils every day to keep the nation informed.

“As ZUJ, we want to assure our members of our relentless pursuit of justice for all so that they are remunerated what is commensurate to their work.”

Mr Maponga said ZUJ will continue to push authorities to make sure that the NEC for the media industry sees the light of the day.

He added that it was disheartening to see that when the rest of the nation is moving ahead with the mantra ‘leaving no one and no place behind’, the media industry found itself behind other sectors in terms of remuneration and salaries.

“We hope ongoing engagements by the ZUJ will result in the creation and birth of a new epoch where journalists are recognised accordingly for their efforts so that at the end of the day they can compare favourably with other sectors in Zimbabwe and beyond.

“I want to assure you that all hope is not lost.

“We will continue fighting for what is rightly ours and we hope in the fullness of time professional journalism will return to its long lost lustre,” said Mr Maponga.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zuj-mulls-single-nec-for-sector/,The Herald,ZUJ mulls single NEC for sector

Telecommunications and technology giant, Econet Wireless, has unveiled two free remittance corridors into the country, completely eliminating the cost to both senders and receivers of foreign currency, marking a first for Africa.

Econet partnered with its sister company, Sasai Money Transfer, to enable individuals and companies in the United Kingdom and South Africa to send money into Zimbabwe free of charge, starting today.

This initiative not only abolishes fees for senders but also ensures that recipients can cash out from their EcoCash wallets without incurring any charges.

With international remittances typically burdened by fees of up to 15 percent for senders and 3 percent for recipients upon cash out, Econet’s bold step is aimed at extending a lifeline to Zimbabweans.

Econet Wireless Zimbabwe chief executive officer Dr Douglas Mboweni said: “We hope Zimbabweans in the Diaspora will use the savings to send more money home to their families,” Dr Mboweni said.

“The majority of remittances to Zimbabwe are conducted through these two main corridors (the UK and South Africa). We don’t have to pay any third parties on those corridors, because we rely on a sister company in the group, which agreed to help out,” he said.

The Econet CEO said he hoped the move by Econet would encourage other companies facilitating remittances into Zimbabwe to reduce their fees, noting that it was time that remittances into Africa in general were brought down to assist with the continent’s economic development agenda.

Dr Mboweni added that the initiative was in support of the Government efforts to increase diaspora remittances coming into the country through formal channels.
