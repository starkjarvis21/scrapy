business,"TheSocial Security Administrationis set to implement new rules to make it easier for beneficiaries to access certain benefits and increase the payments some may receive. The new changes affectSupplemental Security Income, or SSI, which provides more than 7 million Americans with monthly benefit checks. Those benefits are for seniors ages 65 and up, or adults and children who are disabled or blind, and who have little or no income or resources. “We already know that the benefit amounts that are available to people receiving SSI are incredibly low,” said Lydia Brown, director of public policy at the National Disability Institute. “They’re not as high as perhaps they could be to fully account for the needs that people have,” Brown said. The maximum federal monthly SSI benefit is currently$943 per eligible individualand $1,415 for an eligible individual and eligible spouse. The changes, which are slated to go into effect Sept. 30, are a “positive move in the right direction,” Brown said. The agency on Thursday announced a new rule to expand the definition of a public-assistance household. Now, households that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, payments and those where not all members receive public assistance will be included. With the change, more people may qualify for SSI, current beneficiaries may see higher payments and individuals who live in public-assistance households may have fewer reporting requirements, according to the Social Security Administration. The previous policy required all household members to receive public assistance. A public-assistance household will be defined as one with both an SSI applicant or beneficiary, as well as at least one other member who receives one or more forms of means-tested public income maintenance payments. “By simplifying our policies and including an additional program geared towards low-income families, such as the SNAP, we are removing significant barriers to accessing SSI,” Social Security Commissioner Martin O’Malley said in a statement. “These changes promote greater equity in our programs.” The definition of a public-assistance household has not been updated in a very long time, according to Darcy Milburn, director of Social Security and health-care policy at The Arc, a nonprofit organization serving people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. “I would characterize this as just good policy and commonsense changes to update this definition,” Milburn said. What’s more, there are many ways in which SSI is still operating under rules devised in the 1980s, said Brown of the National Disability Institute. SNAP is the first public income maintenance benefit to be added to the public-assistance household definition since 1980, according to the Social Security Administration. Other rule changes to help beneficiaries The Social Security Administration is also working to address outdated practices through two other rules that are set to go into effect on Sept. 30. One change will expand theSSI rental subsidy policyto make it less likely that renting at a discounted rate or other rental assistance will affect a beneficiary’s SSI eligibility or monthly payment amount. That policy, which was already available in seven states, will apply nationally. Another change will make it so the SSAno longer counts food assistancetoward support beneficiaries receive from other parties that may reduce their SSI benefit amounts. The Social Security Administration keeps track of the resources SSI beneficiaries receive outside of their federal benefits, formally known as in-kind support and maintenance, or ISM. The purpose of ISM is to reduce SSI benefits if a recipient receives support from family and friends by treating that as unearned income, Milburn said. That support can reduce an individual’s monthly benefit by as much as one-third, Milburn said. And because the SSA keeps track of that support every month, it’s a lot for the agency to monitor, she said. When the changes go into effect this fall, SSI beneficiaries should notice they have less paperwork to fill out, receive more accurate monthly payments and are faced with fewer administrative burdens, Milburn said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/social-security-administration-expand-access-certain-benefits-several-rcna151655,NBC,Social Security Administration to expand access to certain benefits through several upcoming changes
business,"Sam Altman is now chairman of a public company. But it’s not OpenAI. On Friday, advanced nuclear fission company Oklo started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which has yet to generate any revenue, went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called AltC Acquisition Corp., founded and led by Altman. Under ticker symbol “OKLO,” shares were trading at just above $15 on Friday morning. Oklo was set to receive more than $306 million in gross proceeds upon closing of the transaction, according to a release. Oklo’s business model is based on commercializing nuclear fission, the reaction that fuels all nuclear power plants. Instead of conventional reactors, the company aims to usemini nuclear reactorshoused in A-frame structures. Its goal is to sell the energy to end users such as theU.S. Air Forceand big tech companies. Oklo is currently working to build its first small-scale reactor in Idaho, which could eventually power the types of data centers that OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies need to run their AI models and services. Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has said he sees nuclear energy as one of the best ways to solve the problem of growing demand for AI, and the energy that powers the technology, without relying on fossil fuels. Microsoft co-founderBill Gatesand Amazon founderJeff Bezoshave also invested in nuclear plants in recent years. “I don’t see a way for us to get there without nuclear,” Altman told CNBCin 2021. “I mean, maybe we could get there just with solar and storage. But from my vantage point, I feel like this is the most likely and the best way to get there.” In an interview with CNBC Thursday, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte confirmed the company has yet to generate revenue and has no nuclear plants deployed at the moment. He said the company is targeting 2027 for its first plant to come online. Going the SPAC route is risky. So-called reverse mergers becamepopularin the low interest rate days of 2020 and 2021, when tech valuations were soaring and investors were looking for growth over profit. But the SPAC marketcollapsedin 2022 alongside rising rates, and hasn’t recovered. AI-related companies, on the other hand, are thenew darlingsof Wall Street. “SPACs haven’t exactly had the best performances in the past couple of years, so for us to have sort of the outcome that we’ve had here is obviously a function of the work we put in, but also what we’re building and also the fact that the market sees the opportunity sets here,” said DeWitte, who co-founded the company in 2013. “I think it’s very promising on multiple fronts for [the] nuclear, AI, data center push, as well as the energy transition piece.” The company has seen its fair share of regulatory setbacks. In 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission denied Oklo’s application for an Idaho reactor. The company has been working on a new application, which it isn’t aiming to submit to the NRC until early next year, DeWitte said, adding that it’s currently in the “pre-application engagement” stage with the commission. Altman got involved with Oklo while he was president of startup incubator Y Combinator. Oklo went into the program in 2014, after anearlier meetingbetween Altman and DeWitte. In 2015, Altman invested in the company and became chairman. It’s not his only foray into nuclear energy or other infrastructure that could power large-scale AI growth. In 2021, Altman led a $500 million funding round in clean energy firmHelion, which is working to develop and commercialize nuclear fusion. Helion said in ablog postat the time that the capital would go toward its electricity demonstration generator, Polaris, “which we expect to demonstrate net electricity from fusion in 2024.” Altman didn’t respond to a request for comment. In recent years, Altman has also poured money into chip endeavors and investments that could help power the AI tools OpenAI builds. Just before hisbrief ousteras OpenAI CEO in November, he wasreportedlyseeking billions of dollars for a chip venture codenamed “Tigris” to eventually compete withNvidia. In 2018, Altman invested AI chip startup Rain Neuromorphics, based near OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters. The next year OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on Rain’s chips. In December, the U.S. compelled a Saudi Aramco-backed venture capital firm to sell its shares in Rain. DeWitte told CNBC that the data center represents “a pretty exciting opportunity.” “What we’ve seen is there’s a lot of interest with AI, specifically,” he said. “AI compute needs are significant. It opens the door for a lot of different approaches in terms of how people think about designing and developing AI infrastructure.” Hayden Field is a CNBC reporter MacKenzie Sigalos is a technology reporter for CNBC with a focus on cryptocurrency and fintech.",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/sam-altman-takes-nuclear-energy-company-oklo-public-help-power-ai-ambi-rcna151659,NBC,Sam Altman takes nuclear energy company Oklo public to help power his AI ambitions
business,"HONG KONG — A top public relations executive from Chinese technology firmBaiduapologized Thursday after she made comments in a series of videos that critics said glorified a culture of overwork. Baidu’s head of communications, Qu Jing, drew a public outcry inChinaafter she implied in the videos that she was not concerned about her employees as she was “not their mom” and said she only cared about results. She also said that the relationship between her and her subordinates was purely an “employer-employee relationship.” The backlash was swift, with many on social media platforms such as Weibo criticizing Qu as lacking empathy. Qu posted an apology Thursday on her private WeChat account, where she “sincerely apologized to all netizens” and clarified that she had not sought Baidu’s permission before posting the videos. Qu said that her short videos did not represent Baidu’s stance. Baidu operates China’s dominant search engine as well as theErnie bot, an artificial intelligence service similar toChatGPT. “Many of the criticisms are very pertinent, I am reflecting deeply and humbly accept them,” she said. “There are many inappropriate (things said) in the video that caused external misunderstandings about the company’s values and corporate culture, causing serious harm. I sincerely apologize.” Qu also pledged to improve her communication and management style and care more for her colleagues. Baidu did not immediately comment. The videos, which have since been taken down, came at a time when many young people in China arepushing back against a culture of competitionand grueling hours in the workplace. Qu received criticism for a range of subjects she mentioned in the series of short videos on Douyin, the Chinese equivalent of TikTok. In the series, she brought up an incident of certain employees who sent hundreds of complaint letters against her to the office, and threatened to ruin their careers by ensuring that they could never again find a job in the industry. In one of the videos, she criticized an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic. China had implemented strict travel restrictions that at times included weeks of quarantine for travel even within the country. “Why should I take into consideration my employee’s family? I’m not her mother-in law,” Qu said, adding that if employees refused to go on such business trips then they would not get salary raises or job promotions. Chinese technology firms have long been criticized for their long working hours. A public debate was set off in recent years over the “996” work culture, where employees in technology firms were expected to work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. The issue was also spotlighted after the deaths of two employees of Chinese e-commerce firm Pinduoduo, one of whom collapsed suddenly on the street on her way home from work. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, also faced criticism in 2019 for endorsing the 12-hour workday culture, saying that those who enjoyed their work would not find the “996” practice to be a problem.

business,"WASHINGTON — The Senate late on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a broadaviation billto boostair traffic controller staffing, increase funding to avert runway close-call incidents and speed refunds for canceled flights. The $105 billion, five-year measure reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration. The bill prohibits airlines from charging fees for families to sit together and requires airplanes to be equipped with 25-hour cockpit recording devices — up from the current two-hours — and directs the FAA to deploy advanced airport surface technology to help prevent collisions. The bill adds five daily round-trip flights at busy Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and requires airlines to accept vouchers and credits for at least five years. Efforts to boost aviation safety in the United States have taken on new urgency after a series ofnear-miss incidentsand the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9door plug mid-air emergency. The bill, which is expected to get final approval next week from the House of Representatives, does not raise the mandatory pilot retirement age to 67 as lawmakers had sought to do last year. Earlier this week,lawmakers agreed to revise languageto ensure quick refunds for airline passengers whose flights are canceled who bought non-refundable tickets and who are not seeking alternative flights. The bill raises maximum civil penalties for airline consumer violations from $25,000 per violation to $75,000 and aims to address a shortage of 3,000 air traffic controllers by directing the FAA to implement improved staffing standards and to hire more inspectors, engineers and technical specialists. Congress will not establish minimum seat size requirements, leaving that instead to the FAA. The bill requires the Transportation Department to create a dashboard that shows consumers the minimum seat size for each U.S. airline. Congress alsorejected many other consumer provisionsthe Biden administration sought.

The ad was posted on X by Apple CEO Tim Cook with a caption that read in part; ""Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create."" Online criticism of the ad was nearly universal, with many observers pointing out that while it may have intended to portray the manifold capabilities of the product, it seemed to signify technology as a force  for destroying human agency in creative endeavors.

business,"Credit card holders could be paying more in fees and interest than their travel rewards and other perks are worth, Biden administration officials are arguing, raising scrutiny on loyalty programs that shape millions of people’s spending. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Transportation held a joint hearing in Washington on Thursday that brought together representatives from airlines, financial institutions, unions and consumer advocacy groups to discuss whether new regulations are needed. Regulators arelooking into the promises madearound sign-up bonuses, changes to point values, obstacles in redeeming points and loss of rewards when cards are closed. They’re especially focused on travel rewards, like those offered by airline-branded credit cards that let users rack up frequent flyer miles.Forty-one percent of Americanshave travel rewards credit cards, according to a NerdWallet survey last year. “We’re going to look into how we can make sure companies are being straightforward about what people will get from these frequent flyer miles or loyalty programs when they sign up, and whether people are actually getting the deal that they were promised,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at Thursday’s hearing. The heightened scrutiny on credit card rewards is part of the White House’s broadercrackdown on “junk fees”andother pricing practices, particularly in industries like financial servicesand airlines, that the administration sees as unfairly squeezing consumers and contributing to inflation. In March, the CFPBloweredthe late fees that credit card companies charge,drawing swift industry pushback. Two weeks ago, the Transportation Department said it would require airlines toquickly give cash refundsto passengers whose flights are canceled or seriously delayed. The CFPB, with purview over financial institutions, has cracked down on banks for credit card sign-up bonuses before. Last July, itorderedBank of America to pay more than $100 million for practices including withholding or denying bonus points to tens of thousands of consumers. Federal regulators are now looking more closely at airline credit cards too. Withannual feesas high as $650 and average interest rates of 25.3%, according toLendingTree, they can be much costlier than the average credit card, which in many cases have no annual fees and charge comparatively lower rates, averaging 24.7%. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra told NBC News prior to the hearing that federal authorities could consider regulations, or even law enforcement actions, if they determine companies are breaking their promises to consumers. “We see that for many of these airline rewards programs, credit card companies are charging huge interest rates, sometimes 30% or more. And many consumers actually lose out on these deals. They may be paying way more than the value of the rewards that they accrue,” Chopra said. Even if consumers are able to pay their bills on time and avoid interest payments, consumers have complained about restrictions on using the points they’ve accrued. Buttigieg told NBC News ahead of Thursday’s hearing that he had concerns about “abrupt changes” in the value of points, given the airlines’ control over how many points a flight from, say, New York to Honolulu might cost. Airlines for America, a coalition representing the nation’s largest airlines, said Thursday that there is “fierce competition” within the industry for credit card loyalty, adding that “consumers have the power of choice when picking a carrier for air travel or a credit card for spending, with a wide range of options, to pick what best fits their needs.” The Electronic Payments Coalition, representing credit unions, community banks and payment card networks, points to CFPBdatashowing the value of rewards points has risen from an average 1.4 cents per dollar spent in 2019 to 1.6 cents in 2022. In a statement Thursday, the groupdescribedregulators’ scrutiny of credit card rewards as “politically motivated.” Loyalty programs, which sell points back to consumers at prices they set, have been a big source of revenue for major airlines. Delta Air Linessaidit brought in $6.5 billion in revenue linked to its loyalty programs just last year, and American Airlinessaid80% of its revenue this year will come from loyalty program members. When United Airlines pledged its entire loyalty program for a loan in 2020, itvaluedthe asset at $21.9 billion. Lauren Randall, who lives in Norwalk, Connecticut, told NBC News she recently applied for a travel credit card that offered 40,000 miles at sign-up, only to receive a promotion in the mail just hours later for the very same card offering 60,000 points. She said she called to see if she could receive the better promo but was denied, calling it a “bait and switch.” “It feels like every year, either the seats get smaller, or the prices go up, or there’s some sort of excuse,” Randall said. “It would be great to hold these companies more accountable for the experience and what they promise.” Brian Cheung is a business and data correspondent for NBC News.

business,"Sinclair, one of the largest owners of broadcast stations in the U.S., is looking to sell more than 30% of its footprint, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has hiredMoelisas its investment banker and has identified more than 60 stations in various regions of the U.S. that it would be willing to sell, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Sinclair owns or operates 185 TV stations in 86 markets. The stations are a mix of affiliates including Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS and the CW. If sold together, their average revenue for 2023 and 2024 is an estimated $1.56 billion, the people said. Sinclair is willing to sell all or some of the stations, which are in top markets like Minneapolis; Portland, Ore.; Pittsburgh; Austin, Texas and Fresno, Calif., among others. Sinclair CEO Chris Ripley said Wednesday that the company is open to offloading parts of its business, without providing specifics. “As we’ve always stated, we have no sacred cows,” Ripley said during his company’s earnings conference call. “We want to unlock the sum of the parts valuation that we think we’re grossly undervalued for. And to the extent that asset sales makes sense in order to unlock that value and help us de-lever, then that’s something that we’d be open to as well.” The company began officially shopping them in February, one of the people said. Spokespeople for Sinclair and Moelis declined to comment. Sinclair is also exploring options for its Tennis Channel, a cable TV network that features the sport andpickleball matches, the people said.Bloombergearlier reported that development. Broadcast TV station groups have suffered in the past five years as millions of Americans have canceled traditional pay TV. Most stations make money from so-called retransmission fees, paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors, such as Comcast, DirecTV, and Charter, for the right to carry the stations. Sinclair has lost more than 70% of its market value in the last five years. The company’s market capitalization is about $975 million with an enterprise value of about $4.7 billion. Last year, Sinclair rebranded and reorganized, splitting the company into two operating units — Local Media, which focuses on the stations, and Ventures, which houses Tennis Channel but can also act as an investment vehicle. The split in the company divisions, and the recent sale process for some of its stations, stems from tension within the Smith family, the shareholders and the board directors who helped build Sinclair, some of the people said. The stations are up for sale in the months before the 2024 election, which usually draws high political advertising revenue for broadcast TV companies. Sinclair said during earnings on Wednesday that it pre-booked $77 million in political advertising for the second half of the year through Election Day, compared with $21 million at the same point in 2020, the last time former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden were on the ticket. The company’s overall revenue and advertising revenue both rose slightly during the first quarter. Sinclair’s stock was up 12% on Thursday. Sinclair’s broadcast stations have been known for having a conservative editorial voice, and the company faced backlash in 2018 afterrequiringsome of its stations to read promos criticizing the media about “fake stories.” The process also comes after Sinclair faced headaches in the regional sports networks business. Sinclair acquired the largest portfolio of regional sports networks from Disney in 2019 for $10.6 billion, including $8.8 billion in debt. Between ramped-up cord-cutting and the hefty debt load, Diamond Sports, the independently run and unconsolidated subsidiary of Sinclair, soughtbankruptcyprotection last year.

business,"A federal jury in New York on Thursday convicted an investor ofinsider tradingin the stock of a shell company ahead of its announcement in October 2021 that it would merge withTrump Media. The investor,Bruce Garelick, had been on the board of directors of the publicly traded company,Digital World Acquisition Corp., at the time he was accused of sharing and exploiting non-public information with others about its plans to merge with then-privately held Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app. Trump Media’s majority shareholder is former PresidentDonald Trump, who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case against Garelick in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But Garelick’s trial, which began on April 30, took place just blocks away from where Trump is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court on criminal charges related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Two co-defendants of Garelick, the brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on April 3. Jurors in Garelick’s case began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and a defense lawyer. After several hours of deliberation Thursday, jurors returned guilty verdicts on the five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy that the 54-year-old Garelick faced. Garelick, who testified at his trial, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 12. Garelick was an investment advisor to Michael Shvartsman’s venture capital firm, Rocket One Capital. Prosecutors said Garelick shared non-public material information about DWAC’s merger plans with Trump Media with the Shvartsman brothers in 2021 after joining DWAC’s board. All three men then bought up DWAC stock based on that non-public information and then sold their shares after the price soared following the announcement of the deal to combine with Trump Media, prosecutors said. Garelick made a profit of just $49,000 on the illicit trades, but the Shvartsmans earned a whopping $23 million, according to prosecutors. “Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement Thursday. “When he was given that opportunity, Garelick promised to keep the information about DWAC’s interest in acquiring Trump Media secret and not use it to trade in the stock market. Garelick was also given a seat on DWAC’s board, which gave him direct access to additional non-public information regarding the acquisition,” Williams said. “As a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,” the top prosecutor said. “Garelick’s federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.” DWAC and Trump Media completed their merger in late March. Public trading of the company’s stock under the new ticker DJT began a day later. Last week, theSecurities and Exchange Commissioncharged Trump Media’s auditor with what the regulator said was“massive fraud” involving the auditor’s accounting work for hundreds of publicly traded companies, affecting 1,500 SEC filings. The auditor,BF Borgers CPA, and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, agreed to be permanently suspended from practicing as accountants before the SEC, and to pay a combined $14 million in civil penalties.

business,"A new strategy has emerged in the battle to ban smoking in casinos: the shareholder vote. Shareholders atBoyd Gaming,Bally’s EntertainmentandCaesars Entertainmentwill put on the ballot at the respective casino companies proposals to force them to study the costs associated with permitting smoking indoors — and whether going smoke-free could save money. The proposals are sponsored by Trinity Health, a nonprofit health care network, and the Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation. Trinity Health, based in Livonia, Michigan, has used its shareholder status tofight for various health initiativesdespite the fact that it owns just a tiny fraction of these companies. For example, public records show Trinity owns just 440 shares of Bally’s stock, or about 0.001% of the company. Boyd, Bally’s and Caesars fought to keep the proposals out of the proxy materials distributed to shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission denied the casinos’ requests, and the proposals as well as the rationale behind them were delivered to all shareholders. Boyd will face avote over a smoke-free assessmentat its annual shareholder meeting Thursday. Bally’s holds its annual meeting on May 16, and Caesars will follow with its own meeting, likely in June. The three companies collectively operate 75 U.S. casinos that permit indoor smoking, where state law allows. About 14 states permit indoor smoking in commercial casinos. States like Nevada and New Jersey have prohibited indoor smoking more broadly but carved out exceptions for casinos. Legislation to end indoor smoking at casinos is in various stages in several states across the country, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Advocates for smoking bans point to research by C3 Gaming that concluded smoke-free casinos generate more revenue and outperform competitors that allow smoking. Proposal sponsors argue shareholders should know how much casinos pay in higher health insurance premiums for employees, greater maintenance costs and keeping away customers who hate the smoke. In its proxy, Boyd argues it’s seen a negative impact in states that banned indoor smoking. It argues these decisions are best left up to the properties to follow local trends and says if shareholders succeed in implementing a ban (which Boyd claims is the true goal in forcing an assessment), the company will lose customers to competitors who continue to allow smoking. Caesars board member Jan Jones Blackhurst said Wednesday at the SBC Summit North America, an online gaming conference, that she believes the decision of whether to ban smoking in casinos should be left up to governments. She pointed out that experience has shown that smoke-free casinos can take an economic hit. “Generally, if you look across the United States, when casinos prohibit smoking, revenues fall anywhere from 20% to 25%, which also then have a huge layoff factor with people starting to lose their jobs,” she said. Unions are mixed in their responses. While some worry about the potential of job losses, the United Auto Workers, which represents more than 10,000 table game dealers across the country, has ramped up its efforts in the fight against in-casino smoking, citing secondhand exposure for employees. TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionsays “no amount of exposure to secondhand smoke is safe and the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is through 100% smoke free indoor air environments.” The U.S. surgeon general says that many common practices found in casinos such as separating smoking versus non-smoking sections, cleaning the air and ventilating buildings are not effective protections against secondhand smoke. Casino operator Parx, which runs locations in Pennsylvania, decided to stay smoke-free during the Covid pandemic at its property in Bensalem, north of Philadelphia. It competes with four other local casinos that allow smoking indoors but said it hasn’t seen its market share suffer. “Financially, we know we’ve lost some customers, but we also know we’ve gained some customers. We don’t think we’ve seen a significant impact either way,” Parx spokesperson Marc Oppenheimer told CNBC. Instead, the company said it focuses on guest satisfaction scores and surveys that indicate a boost to employee morale. In Las Vegas,MGM Resortsopened the first casino resort on the Strip to prohibit indoor smoking and even smoking on the pool deck. On its website, the property declares, “Here at Park MGM, we’re not afraid to be different and, as you may have noticed, we’re all about what’s fresh. Now, that includes the air you breathe.” For now, Park MGM is the exception, but smoke-free advocates hope soon, it’ll be the rule.

business,"AConsumer Financial Protection Bureauregulation thatpromisedto save Americans billions of dollars inlate feeson credit cards faces a last-ditch effort to stave off its implementation. Led by theU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the card industry in Marchsuedthe CFPB in federal court to prevent the new rule from taking effect. That effort, whichbouncedbetween venues in Texas and Washington, D.C., for weeks, is now about to reach a milestone: a judge in the Northern District of Texas is expected to announce by Friday evening whether the court will grant the industry’s request for a freeze. That could hold up the regulation, which wouldslashwhat most banks can charge in late fees to $8 per incident, just days before it was totake effecton Tuesday. “We should get some clarity soon about whether the rule is going to be allowed to go into effect,” saidTobin Marcus, lead policy analyst at Wolfe Research. The credit card regulation is part of PresidentJoe Biden’sbroader election-year war against what he deemsjunk fees. Big card issuers have steadily raised the cost of late fees since 2010, profiting off users with low credit scores whorack up$138 in fees annually per card on average,accordingto CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. As expected, the industry has mounted a campaign to derail the regulations, deeming them a misguided effort thatredistributescosts to those who pay their bills on time, and ultimately harms those it purports to benefit by making it more likely for users to fall behind. Up for grabs is the$10 billionin fees per year that the CFPB estimates the rule would save American families by pushing down late penalties to $8 from a typical $32 per incident. Card issuers includingCapital OneandSynchronyhave already talked about efforts to offset the revenue hit they would face if the rule takes effect. They could do so by raising interest rates, adding new fees for things like paper statements, or changing who they choose to lend to. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said last month that, if implemented, the CFPB rule would impact his bank’s revenue for a “couple of years” as the company takes “mitigating actions” to raise revenue elsewhere. “Some of these mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway,” Fairbank told analysts during the company’s first-quarter earnings call. “We are planning on additional actions once we learn more about where the litigation settles out.” Like someotherobservers, Wolfe Research’s Marcus believes the Chamber of Commerce is likely to prevail in its efforts to hold off the rule, either via the Northern District of Texas or through the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. If granted, a preliminary injunction could hold up the rule until the dispute is settled, possibly through a lengthy trial. The industry group, which includes Washington, D.C.-based trade associations like the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association, filed its lawsuit in Texas because it is widely viewed as a friendlier venue for corporations, Marcus said. “I would be very surprised if [Texas Judge Mark T.] Pittman denies that injunction on the merits,” he said. “One way or another, I think implementation is going to be blocked before the rule is supposed to go into effect.” The CFPB declined to comment, and the Chamber of Commerce didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/cfpb-rule-americans-10-billion-year-late-fees-faces-possible-last-minu-rcna151523,NBC,CFPB rule to save Americans $10 billion a year in late fees faces possible last-minute freeze
