President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

“The Zimbabwean workers are victims of these illegal sanctions and today we want to give them solidarity. Our message to all the oppressed people and the workers in the world is we salute you.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/workers-efforts-hailed/,The Herald,Workers’ efforts hailed

Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has exposed 11 cases of fake doctors this year alone, as people take advantage of the vastness of the country’s largest referral medical institution to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

He has since appeared in court.",https://www.herald.co.zw/pari-exposes-11-fake-doctors-in-4-months/,The Herald,Pari exposes 11 fake doctors in 4 months

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

“I don’t want to appear like we want to reverse the brain drain, but let those who train in Zambia remain in Zambia and those we train remain here.",https://www.herald.co.zw/health-workforce-to-double-by-2028/,The Herald,

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and business organisations will be held during the business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

The late national hero and leader of the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa (ZAOGA), Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, was a visionary leader who valued the empowerment of children through education, Information and Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingimuzi Phuti said this week.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Ezekiel Guti Christian Primary School in Riverside, Chitungwiza, after touring the school as part of preparations for the Ezekiel Guti Day to be commemorated on Saturday, he said: “I am humbled by the vision of our departed hero, Baba Guti, the vision that put the concerns of a human being to reality, the vision that foresaw things that we are beginning to discover today, the importance of taking a child to school, the knowledge that it doesn’t have to be the responsibility of Government alone.

“It’s the responsibility that is more entangled with care and understanding the reason to empower somebody through education that drove him. But apart from that we are really touched by the ahead of time kind of man he was,” he said.

Deputy Minister Phuti said the programme was meant to celebrate the life of an illustrious son of Zimbabwe whose visionary leadership was noticeable not only in Zimbabwe alone but impacted lives around the world.

The ministry has partnered the Ezekiel Guti Primary School to train youths in the use of ICT.

“In honour of the legacy of Baba Guti we decided that we come in with our digital relevance hence that training we have organised in partnership with your administration.

“We hope that the training will not only open up the eyes of our youngsters but will motivate them to pursue other relevant skills from this,” he said.

Archbishop Guti’s widow, Apostle Eunor Guti expressed her gratitude to the Ministry for the partnership.

“I would like to thank the Ministry of ICT for partnering with us and joining the Zaoga family as we celebrate the life and legacy of our father, Professor Guti,” she said.

Sports,"May Day may be a fairly quiet holiday but it is a very important one as it concentrates minds on the position of workers within the economy and the need to ensure that their contribution is recognised.

Their rights and expectations are also taken into account.

President Mnangagwa set the tone with his statement on the eve of the public holiday, that the workers are an essential part of the economic growth through their production and productivity, and their importance cannot be minimised. Without the workers there is no production and they are entitled to their fair share of the wealth their efforts produce.

The Government is the largest employer, and runs almost all the essential services that the rest of us need to produce and to work, so as Head of Government he renewed his commitment that conditions of service will be continually improved within the State sector.

There are obvious limits to just how fast remuneration can be raised and the non-monetary benefits can be implemented and increased. We are not going to print money, or even borrow money, to pay civil servants more since that just leads to economic challenges.

But as the economy grows the tax revenue grows and so more can be done each year to improve the conditions of State workers. The Government, within its fiscal discipline that is now so essential, has maintained the percentage of revenue spent on staff, and maintained it as the largest item in the budget, so economic growth automatically means more can be spent.

The commitment by the President not to take State workers for granted and to maintain the policy of continual improvement as the economy grows is, therefore, important. He recognises their essential input and he wants to treat them fairly.

The President also made his appeal to the private sector, which employs considerably more people than the State, even with the growth of self-employment, to again follow a similar policy of continual improvement and making sure that workers are treated fairly and get their fair share of the wealth being created. Again this is the result of a growing economy, growing production and growing investment.

A major plank of President Mnangagwa’s policy is the Vision 2030, pushing Zimbabwe upwards into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. That is not just a mantra, since we have to think about what that journey means.

The only way to have a successful and continuous increase in national wealth is to make sure that everyone benefits.

That in turn increases growth. Even the arch-capitalist Henry Ford grabbed that point early on as he introduced mass production of motor cars. He worked out that he was not going to succeed unless his own very large workforce could afford to buy the cars they made, so he raised wages and was able to pay these through the higher productivity his assembly lines generated as well as the growing stream of revenue from his growing sales. Everything worked together.

The growing number of the self-employed win as well when employers are fair. Those civil servants and private-sector workers spend the money they earn, and spend quite a lot of it on the goods and services that the self-employed provide. So they win and the whole nation together moves forward. In any case, the small businesses become larger and start hiring people, so they need to remember that they must pay their new workers their just dues.

The Government follows this policy by using the small-scale farming sectors to drive rural development. The whole policy is based on the premise that converting subsistence farmers into small commercial farmers creates the wealth that drives rural industrialisation and the growing percentage of rural dwellers who provide the goods and services that the farmers require and want.

In a developed economy a huge majority of rural dwellers are not farmers, but the underlying rural economy is based on farm production, so the Second Republic rural development policy is based on fact and functional theory, not on some pipedream. Vision 2030 is based on the need for the people, as well as the national economy, to be upper middle income.

While the Second Republic has streamlined labour law, to make it easier to understand and implement, it has retained the essential core that workers and employees are human beings who have rights, as well as duties, and has retained the whole gamut of the national employment councils and workers committees that have been so effective in ensuring that employers and employees can negotiate properly and equally. It has strengthened the similar system in State service, so there is a joint negotiating forum.

The national employment councils were created in settler days to benefit the white workers. They were partially extended under the more liberal settler regime of the late 1950s to more of the formal sector, but only started flourishing fully after independence when everyone was included fully in spirit as well as law.

But they need to be used. Some sectors have very strong and effective NECs and not only do employees benefit, but employers have found that they also benefit by having agreements that work and so can be factored into operations. So they make sure that proper and accurate data is available and enforce the NEC decisions.

Some sectors have very weak NECs, the commercial workers especially, and both employers and employees need to upgrade these.  Sometimes past splits give rise to the oddity that workers in the same sector, and even under the same employer, fall under different NECs. Combining them so that the strongest and best represents all workers in a sector makes sense, for both sides.

Labour law is there to create the practical conditions that President Mnangagwa spoke so strongly about, the need for employers and employees to be fair, and for workers to receive their just share of the growing wealth and basically to ensure that workers who fulfil their duties conscientiously are not treated as cogs in a machine but as co-creators of that extra wealth.",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-drivers-of-the-economy-need-recognition-fair-remuneration/,The Herald,

ZIFA appear to have closed the door on former Zimbabwe internationals Norman Mapeza and Bruce Grobbelaar and all prospective coaches they have recently interviewed for the Warriors job.

Instead, the Normalisation Committee running ZIFA on Tuesday brewed a shocker when they decided to re-advertise for the post.

Lincoln Mutasa’s Normalisation Committee have chosen to keep Zimbabweans guessing on a number of issues around the status of the nation’s flagship sport.

This includes an update on the reform process they are undertaking at ZIFA since their appointment by FIFA on July 11 last year, appointment of substantive national teams’ coaches, election roadmap and the venue of the Warriors’ next World Cup home assignment.

On Tuesday, Mutasa and his committee made an about turn on the interviews they had carried after the former Dynamos chairman claimed that they had received more than 100 applications for the Warriors job.

ZIFA had also literally auditioned Brazilian Baltemar Brito and Mapeza when they appointed them to take charge of the Warriors on an interim basis.

Mutasa and his crew also interviewed Warriors and Liverpool legend Grobbelaar on his visit to Harare in March.

Former Warriors defenders Kaitano Tembo and George Mbwando had also put their hands up for the Warriors job.

The Normalisation Committee who met last week reportedly hit a deadlock on the choice of Warriors coach amid indications that they were being pressured by some agents and cartels on who to appoint.

Despite receiving numerous applications for the Warriors job, ZIFA are still not satisfied and have started a fresh search just 30 days before Zimbabwe host Lesotho a World Cup, Group C qualifier on June 3.

The identity of the venue of that match against Lesotho has also not been made public.

ZIFA’s bid to lure Nyasa Big Bullets coach Kalisto Pasuwa from his job with the serial Malawi champions also hit a snag with the former Dynamos man electing to stay at his club.

Although ZIFA authorities have repeatedly chosen not to respond to media inquiries despite chief executive officer Yvonne Manwa acknowledging receipt of the questions, they let the cat out of the bag on their Warriors intentions, through the advert which they also placed through the FIFA website.

The move to restart the search for the Warriors coach also suggests that ZIFA have disbanded the technical committee, which included the likes of Moses Chunga and Gibson Homela, who they had set up to assist them in identifying the right personnel for the national teams’ posts.

According to the advert, “the candidates should hold higher qualifications like the CAF Pro Licence, CAF A Licence or any Pro-licence and have a minimum five years of international football experience at senior levels.

“The coach’s mandate will be to lead the senior men’s national team and direct the program and preparations for the team for various tournaments, including the 2025 AFCON qualifiers, the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and COSAFA tournaments.”

Mapeza was the last coach to work with the Warriors after he was once again appointed on interim basis to lead the side to a Four-Nations invitational tournament in Malawi in March.

Although there had been indications that Mapeza’s mandate would be extended to cover the World Cup qualifiers, ZIFA seem to have been influenced by reports of a public fallout between Italy-based midfielder Jordan Zemura’s camp and the FC Platinum coach.

It is not immediately clear how much time the new coach will have before he plans for the Warriors clash against Lesotho and South Africa, away a week later.

Ex-Highlanders coach Brito got the Warriors World Cup qualification bid underway when he took charge of the opening games against Rwanda and Nigeria in Huye which both ended in draws.

The Warriors first featured in a goalless draw with Rwanda, which was followed by a 1-1 stalemate against West African giants Nigeria.

The Normalisation Committee initially advertised for the vacant Warriors job in August last year, a month after their appointment by FIFA.

Among those that expressed interest then was Romanian–Hungarian coach Csaba Laszlo, who has vast experience coaching in both the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa leagues, Frank Nuttal of Scotland and Macedonian Gjoko Hadzievski.

The trio were among the over 15 foreign coaches to show interest in the job.

Lately Mbwando, a holder of UEFA A licence also submitted his application to ZIFA while Tembo, currently unattached since leaving South African Premiership side Sekhukhune United also expressed his interest.

The 53-year-old Tembo, a former Warriors vice-captain told a South-African-based online publication Far Post that he was available for the Warriors job should ZIFA consider him.

“I’ve gained a lot of experience, and for me, I’m a coach, and when you’re a coach, you don’t say I don’t want to coach. If the opportunity comes for me to coach the Warriors, I’m available. I’m a coach, and I can coach anywhere.

“I won’t say they haven’t approached me, but the most important thing to say is that I am available,’’ Tembo said.

Among other key attributes, ZIFA are looking for now is that the candidate must have “extensive international football knowledge and experience” at senior national team level and “prior experience coaching an African national team” as well as “familiarity with the role of sport science in preparing players for international competitions.”

The deadline for applications is this Sunday followed by interviews in the coming weeks.

Although there is a strong move within the Normalisation Committee to hire an expatriate, ZIFA’s history of a flawed recruitment of foreign coaches has been the major difference between Zimbabwe and their neighbours like South Africa and Zambia.

South Africa have enjoyed relative success with expatriates including incumbent and Nations Cup winner – Belgian Hugo Broos – while Zambia are on the rise again under ex-Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who boasts of huge experience with both European and African football.

Croat Zdravko “Loga’’ Logarusic, who had a disastrous spell with the senior team was the last substantive Warriors coach.

DESPITE leading Castle Lager Premier Soccer League newboys Bikita Minerals to a decent start to life in the top-flight, Saul Chaminuka may be on the verge of quitting the lithium miners.

Chaminuka has hinted that he is not a happy man at Bikita Minerals and has now been strongly linked with a cross over to Green Fuel, where the coaching job became vacant following the departure of Rodwell Dhlakama and his assistant Darlington Dodo.

Sources told Zimpapers Sports Hub that Chaminuka has also emerged among the front runners to replace Dhlakama at ambitious Green Fuel.

The sources indicated that a deal is expected to be thrashed out in time to allow Chaminuka to lead Green Fuel when they travel to Mandava for a date against former champions FC Platinum on Saturday.

Green Fuel chairman Fredson Moyo could not be reached for a comment, while Chaminuka declined to discuss the matter and referred all questions to the Chisumbanje outfit.

The experienced Chaminuka has lately won admiration for the brave manner in which he tried to save Black Rhinos from relegation.

Despite Bikita having a delayed start to the Premiership, Chaminuka has found a way to mould them into a competitive outfit.

Before settling for Bikita Minerals, Chaminuka who has also previously seen duty in Eswatini, received several offers at the beginning of this season, including a chance to return to relegated Triangle United, a team he coached more than 15 years ago in the ZIFA Eastern Region Division One.

He however, chose to remain in the Premiership where he has done well with Bikita Minerals winning three, secured as many draws and lost twice.

Bikita Minerals sit on eighth position on the 18-team log table with 12 points and six behind leaders Highlanders who have played a game more.

Although he was reluctant to discuss his immediate future, Chaminuka suggested he was being frustrated when he posted: “The most difficult thing is working for people who do not appreciate you but further sabotage your efforts,’’ on one of his social media platforms.",https://www.herald.co.zw/chaminuka-linked-to-green-fuel/,The Herald,Chaminuka linked to Green Fuel

LADY Chevrons coach Walter Chawaguta was left heartbroken yesterday after his charges lost their final group game to the Netherlands and, for the second consecutive time, failed to qualify for the ICC T20 World Cup.

The Zimbabwe senior women’s cricket team failed to progress beyond the group stage of the qualifying tournament, unlike the last campaign two years ago when they fell at the last hurdle.

Chawaguta could not hide his disappointment after watching his charges fell to Netherlands by 14 runs in their final group match yesterday.

Having won one game out four group matches, the Lady Chevrons gaffer felt his charges performed below expectations.

“Obviously I’m very disappointed. We prepared well and thought we had all our resources put together nicely to do well and go on to the semi-finals and into the finals.

“Unfortunately, we played badly, fielded badly and our batting just wasn’t up to the point,” said Chawaguta.

The coach felt the team was caught wanting on all fronts at the World Cup qualifying tournament.

“We just didn’t handle certain scenarios with the bat or even more, so our catching was just poor.

“So, we gave the opposition more than we should have.

“They’re a whole lot of things that just didn’t come right. So, we have to go back home and go to the drawing board and see what we need to improve,” said Chawaguta.

After suffering a six-wicket defeat at the hands of Vanuatu, the Lady Chevrons re-ignited their hopes of qualifying with an eight-wicket victory against hosts UAE. But they blew up their qualifying chances with a 36-run defeat to Ireland earlier this week.

Zimbabwe went into yesterday’s match needing nothing short of victory against the Netherlands, but it was not to be as they suffered their fourth defeat of the tournament.

The defeat meant they were effectively eliminated from the tournament as they finished with only two points from the expected eight.

The Netherlands won the toss yesterday and elected to bat first. They posted a total of 135 runs for the loss of five wickets.  Zimbabwe, who have struggled with chasing, were again caught wanting after they were restricted to 121/4 in their allotted 20 overs.

FOR a boy, who was raised in the crime prone high-density suburb of Mbare, Clive Mandivei’s decision to become a ministry worker back in 2016, was a unique one.

He began a fresh journey as a ministry worker within the Prophetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries (PHD).

Apart from being an usher at Walter Magaya’s church, he would also assist in the Parish’s canteen.

During the same period Khama Billiat was making waves across Africa.

The former Warriors talisman was named the second-best footballer in Africa in January 2016, after helping Mamelodi Sundowns to win the CAF Champions League.

His teammate and goalkeeper Dennis Onyango won the top gong.

While Billiat was rocking on the continent, for both club and country, Mandivei was an unknown entity in local football circles.

But, a lot of things changed when Magaya decided to form Yadah Stars, who were subsequently promoted into the Premier Soccer League back in 2018.

The club gave a lot of unheralded players, including Mandivei, an opportunity to try their luck at football.

A lot also changed for Billiat, who shifted from Sundowns to Kaizer Chiefs where he spent a forgettable five seasons, before leaving the Soweto giants in June last year.

Billiat returned home in February and is now playing alongside Mandivei, who also captains Yadah.

Yadah are currently on a purple patch and they stretched their unbeaten run to four matches when they beat Chicken Inn 2-1 at Heart Stadium on Saturday, thanks to a brace from the penalty spot by Billiat.

With two wins and two draws in their last four outings, Yadah have picked up eight points out of a possible 12.

Billiat has now scored three goals in his last two matches, and Mandivei thinks the former Ajax Cape Town star, will bang “many goals this season.”

“Being a captain is one of the greatest honor an athlete can get, and captaining one of the best players in Africa is more than an honour,” says Mandivei.

“To be frank, I don’t have enough words to describe the feeling. It has been privilege to train with a player of Billiat’s calibre.

“It’s something that happens once in a blue moon.”

While most of the attention has been on Billiat since his grand arrival at Yadah in February, the forward has remained humble.

His teammates are also benefiting a lot from the gifted player.

“Sometimes he will not say anything but his actions speak volumes.

“You can see Billiat is someone who is hungry for success, he is always positive in both his words and actions, no matter the situation.

“He is humble and hardworking. He believes that for him to be the best version of himself or anyone to be the best, it starts with the team as iron sharpens iron.

“He is not after personal glory but he puts the team first.”

Mandivei will make his 74th league appearance for Yadah when The Miracles Boys host Simba Bhora at Rufaro on Saturday.

“If the truth be told, we are not a bad side.

“I believe we a very good squad which is capable of challenging for honours. We have been creating chances and that is important,” added Mandivei.

After failing to win in their opening five matches of, Yadah have turned the tables and are on a four-match unbeaten run.

“In a game of football you win, draw or lose.

“The league campaign is like a war with battles every week. If you lose a battle, it doesn’t mean you have lost the war,’’ Mandivei said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/as-fate-would-have-it-a-former-cook-now-captains-billiat/,The Herald,"As fate would have it, a former cook now captains Billiat"

THE African Union Sports Council (AUSC) Region Five Games are set to include martial arts in next year’s edition, scheduled for Windhoek, Namibia from May 2-11.

In line with the new development, AUSC have also extended an invitation to members of the Region 5 Karate Confederation including the Zimbabwe National Karate Federation to send a team to the annual games.

This comes just two months after ZNKF also sent karatekas to the 13th African Games in Accra, Ghana in March.

But in extending an invitation to ZNKF, AUSC, through their chief executive Stanley Mutoya, also listed seven conditions which the local body and other associations would have to adhere to.

“We are pleased to announce that karate has been included in the official programme of the 11th Edition of the Region 5 Youth Games scheduled for Windhoek, Namibia from 2 to 11 May 2025,” read part of the letter from Mutoya.  AUSC also gave the federation until Friday to ensure they comply with the conditions they have listed.

The conditions include that:

The ZNKF would have to appoint a technical delegate, an official, who will be assigned and responsible for the event next year
The official, however, cannot hold the position of a confederation president or secretary-general and the union will have to provide the said person’s name and contact details
ZNKF will also have to notify the AUSC of the style for the competition and make public the proposed team size they intend to send to the event
This list must include the number of athletes, coaches and referees’’.

ZNKF are also expected to send the information by tomorrow and also confirm in writing their acceptance of the offer.  Soon after, the union is then expected to start working on a technical manual, which is expected to be handed in by May 31.

ZNKF president, who is also the regional karate boss  Joe Rugwete was naturally excited by karate’s latest inclusion in a continental competition.

“The acceptance of our application to participate in the mainstream AUSC Region 5 Games is a momentous occasion for karate in Southern Africa,’’ Rugwete said.

“It signifies the recognition of our sport on a regional platform and provides an invaluable opportunity for our athletes to showcase their skills and talent to a wider audience.

“This inclusion not only elevates the status of karate in the region but also opens up doors for greater exposure and growth of the sport.

“For our youthful athletes, this opportunity holds immense promise and inspiration. Being able to compete in a prestigious event like the AUSC Region 5 Games will not only enhance their competitive experience but also serve as a platform for them to learn, grow, and interact with athletes from various disciplines.’’

Rugwete said local young karatekas stand to benefit the most from Zimbabwe’s participation at the Region 5 Games.

“This exposure can be pivotal in their development as athletes and can instill in them a sense of pride and motivation to excel in their karate pursuits.

“As we move forward with our preparations for these Games, we are committed to supporting and nurturing our young athletes, providing them with the necessary guidance, training, and resources to help them succeed on this regional stage.

“We are confident that their participation in this event will not only be a memorable experience for them but will also contribute to the overall development and promotion of karate in our region.

“We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to making a positive impact at the Games,’’ he said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/karate-for-ausc-region-5-games/,The Herald,Karate for AUSC Region 5 Games

UNITED States-based Zimbabwean football star Francis Motsi is making waves in collegiate football with his IOWA Lakes Community College in Spencer.

Motsi, who plays as a left or right wide midfielder, recently won the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) award as well as the National Championship with his side after he managed to break into the school’s first team.

The former Prince Edward and Zengeza High 1 student, who previously played for Prince Edward Academy, Academy 2063, Power Eleven Academy and World Athletes Recruit, said he is looking forward to do well again this year.

“I am happy that I am making good progress after I joined the college in 2022. The level of competition is high and I am working hard to see my career grow.

“My intention is to play football professionally and at some point represent my country.

“I am on a scholarship with great mentorship and sponsorship by a great person, a father of two girls who I am not sure would love to have his name on the papers, but he is the reason I met the financial needs to chase my dreams.

“I am also grateful Archibald Tafadzwa Chisango, my elder brother, a great man who sacrificed all he had to make sure I am properly facilitated,” said Motsi.

Motsi grew up in Chitungwiza’s Zengeza 4 and attended Prince Edward School and Zengeza 1 High School before he left for State IOWA, in the United States of America in 2022 under a scholarship to fulfil his academic and footballing dream.

Motsi, who is also known by the nickname “Franco”, is fast emerging as one of his team’s key players for IOWA Lakes Community College.

The midfielder went to the United States to further his commercial degree studies after his first degree from National University of Science and Technology.

He played an important part in NUST’s third place finish in the 2021 Zimbabwe University’s Sports Association (ZUSA) Games which were held in Harare, scoring two important goals.

The attacking midfielder, who is inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo, also spoke of how he balances schoolwork and football, stating that to him it is natural and it has no formula.

“No formula really, it’s just about doing what you need for what you want. The two might be confused so it’s better to do them both so when you finally get to know what you want and what you really need, you will have two already and what will be left is to place them in the right position,” added Motsi.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zim-star-makes-waves-in-us/,The Herald,Zim Star makes waves in US

DYNAMOS coach Genesis Mangombe says Sadney Urikhob is a magnificent striker who can step in and play a big part in answering some of the Harare giants’ goalscoring problems.

The big Namibian forward has come under the microscope after a slow start to life at the Glamour Boys which pales the hype he received upon joining the team early this year.

With DeMbare struggling to pick solid form especially in front of goal, pressure has been mounting, for Urikhob to deliver especially.

That his partners in attack, Alexander Mandinyenya and Emmanuel Paga are already off the mark with three goals between themselves has only served to add more pressure on Urikhob.

Dynamos have scored just seven goals in eight games with Paga, who has netted twice the team’s leading scorer.

Urikhob’s shortcomings have been made largely evident by the value brought by fellow newcomer Frederick Ansah-Botchway of Ghana, whose industry in midfield has already won him so many admirers.

But Mangombe, who himself has shaken off the pressure that had followed his team’s indifferent start, has come out in full support of his striker.

“Sadney Urikhob is an impressive prospect with extraordinary qualities.

“He just needs to get that opening goal and start going,” said Mangombe.

“You look at the amount of energy that he throws in, his off the ball runs and ability to be a team player.

“I think we just need to be a bit patient with him. He is coming into a new league at a team with so much expectations but he is making huge strides in terms of adaptation.

“I believe in his capabilities and if I look at him closely, I have no doubt that he will play a major role in helping the team achieve its goals.

“He is a great team player who is not only limited to scoring goals but can also string good passes in the attacking third while also playing huge roles defensively.

“I am confident that with what he has shown me, Urikhob can be a great deal in our ambitions this season.”

A number of Dynamos players haven’t yet arrived on the scene this term but it is Urikhob, who has received the larger part of the brickbats being thrown by doubters.

The forward will this Saturday get another opportunity to win over the DeMbare fans when his side face Chicken Inn in a league game at Barbourfields.

Urikhob and Dynamos will be looking to pocket the maximum points and improve their position on the log.

They currently sit in mid-table with eight points wedging them from pacesetters Highlanders, notwithstanding the possibility of them being awarded three points from their aborted match against Chegutu Pirates a fortnight ago.

They were leading 1-0 in that encounter when rogue elements decided to force a stop to the encounter but Dynamos know they cannot count on something, which is not in their control.

DeMbare will need to be at their best to get something against Chicken Inn who have had a promising start under returning coach Joey Antipas.  One of their most consistent performers and vice-captain Emmanuel Jalai is out of the tie as he will be serving suspension for picking three yellow cards.

They will also be without skipper Frank Makarati who has been grounded by a knee sprain.

“We will certainly miss captain Frank Makarati and his vice Emmanuel Jalai. They really play key roles with their leadership qualities inside the field of play,’’ said Mangombe.

“However, we have good players who will fit in and try to help the club while showing us what they can give.

“At the end of the day, we need to win the game against Chicken Inn. Chicken Inn is a very good team and we really need to arrive at the party,’’ added Mangombe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/mangombe-backs-his-namibian-man/,The Herald,Mangombe backs his Namibian man

REIGNING National Association of School Heads (NASH) chess champion Matifadzaishe Mhungu is racing against time to get her lifetime opportunity of taking part in the Africa Youth Chess Championship (AYCC) scheduled for Ekurhuleni in Gauteng, South Africa, from June 15 to 23.

The 17-year-old Howard High School student won the ticket to represent the country when she won at the Cook More sponsored chess championship at Chipindura in Bindura early last month.

It will be the third time that Mhungu will be missing out on such an opportunity despite her talent in the sport.

“My first medal came in 2019 when I won the Under-12 categories before I won the 2022 NASH Under-15.

“The win in 2022 was supposed to see me travel to Namibia in 2022 but again because of financial challenges I failed. It was last year again that I won the Under-16 category at Cheziya and I was supposed to make the trip to Cairo, Egypt, but again I could not afford it.

“This year I am supposed to be taking part in the tournament in South Africa which has a ticket to qualify for the World Youth Championship set for Brazil later this year.

“I feel pain that my parents cannot afford to help me get a basic such as a passport as we come from a poor background and my talent is not getting to its full potential,” said Mhungu.

The athlete is hopeful that some corporates will come on board as she is racing against time to register with the Zimbabwe Chess Federation whose deadline for confirmation is May 5.

Mhungu’s mother, Easter, said they are not giving up hope as there are some organisations who have pledged to support them.

“I think the dates for the deadline are a challenge. We received the letter on April 24 and the registration will only close on May 5. We do not have much time since she does not have a passport and the trip is self-sponsored which will be difficult for us.

“My daughter is going as an additional player and she will foot all her travel and accommodation fares.

In just over two hours, a feisty Lehecka thwarted Nadal’s hopes of reaching his 100th Masters 1000 quarter-final after a fairytale run in only his second tournament since January as the Spaniard struggled with injury.  Nadal has said he expects to retire after the 2024 season.

“I’m happy. It was a very special week for me, very positive in every way.

“I was able to play again on a court that has given me a lot, also on an emotional level,” the 37-year-old Nadal said in an on-court interview in front of an emotional crowd.

“It has been unforgettable, and I can only say ‘thank you’. It has been an incredible journey. It’s very difficult, but life and my body have been sending signals to me for a long time.

“I have been fortunate to turn my passion into my job. I am privileged,” he said before organisers honoured him with a trophy and unfurled banners paying tribute to his five Madrid titles.

With the score level at 5-5 in the first set, 30th seed Lehecka broke serve and then held his own to take the lead.

Breaking again in the first game of the second set, the 22-year-old secured the win to reach the quarter-finals.

“It’s amazing. For me to share the court with such a legendary player is a dream come true. I always wished to have this happen. I’m very grateful to achieve such a big moment,” Lehecka said.

“All the best to Rafa. It’s kind of bittersweet to have such a nice win in front of all these people cheering for him. The energy was amazing, it was like I was in another universe.

Sports,"London. — Harry Kane has revealed Jude Bellingham said “you are going to go left of the keeper” as the Real Madrid midfielder tried to put off his England team-mate before the Bayern Munich forward took his penalty in the Champions League semi-final.

Bellingham could be seen mumbling something to Kane as the Bayern striker stepped up to take the spot-kick in the 57th minute of the first leg.

However, the England captain placed his penalty to the right of goalkeeper Andriy Lunin to give Bayern a 2-1 lead at Allianz Arena – although Vinicius Junior later also converted from the spot as the match ended all square.

Kane said he did not hear what Bellingham said on the pitch but that the 20-year-old told him after the match.

“In the moment, I didn’t know what he said but I spoke to him after and he said: ‘I know you are going to go left of the keeper’.

“On the pitch, I knew he was there but I didn’t know what he said. But I went left anyway.

“It was nice for me because I saw the keeper go a little bit early and I put it away.”

It was Kane’s 43rd goal in 43 games in all competitions this season and helps Bayern in their aim of finishing the season on a high, with the Champions League the only trophy they remain in contention for.

Kane left Tottenham last summer for an initial £86m in the hope of winning trophies with 11-time Bundesliga champions Bayern.  But Bayer Leverkusen have already halted that run while Thomas Tuchel’s side were knocked out of the German Cup in the second round by third-tier side Saarbrucken.

In addition to deciding the final placings for the individual crown, the event will determine seedings for the LIV Team Championship.

“It will be an incredible setting for a high-stakes event as players battle it out for the individual title and a roster spot for 2025,” said LIV Golf commissioner Greg Norman.

Players who finish in the top 24 of the season standings will secure spots for the 2025 season while those with expiring contracts in the 25-48 positions will become free agents.

Those lower would be relegated out and forced into a promotion tournament to regain a LIV Golf berth in 2025.

There is already uncertainty around LIV Golf’s 2025 campaign with its Saudi financiers, the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), in merger talks with the PGA Tour, negotiations that have stretched well beyond a deadline at the end of 2023.

Thus far, the upstart circuit that lured away several top PGA Tour players has awaited news following last June’s framework agreement merger plan between the PGA Tour and PIF, one that shocked PGA Tour players after months of feuding between the rival tours.

Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen staff were filmed celebrating Roma’s passage past AC Milan in the last eight, and today’s first leg at the Stadio Olimpico is a chance to purge the memory of being ‘Mourinhoed’ in last season’s last four.

Already a formidable proposition last term, Leverkusen’s astonishing run of 46 matches without defeat and a first-ever Bundesliga title has them favourites to reach the final in Dublin.

And the team which broke Bayern Munich’s dominance of German football wants payback for the 1-0 aggregate loss which led to Roma’s agonising penalty shoot-out defeat to Sevilla in last season’s final.

“We have a desire for revenge, and a great hunger to win and get ourselves into the final,” said Leverkusen CEO Fernando Corro to Radio Marca.

“We want to get to the final at all costs.”

Leverkusen have scored 16 goals in stoppage time this season in all competitions, the latest coming in the 96th minute of last weekend’s 2-2 draw with Stuttgart.

And it’s been their habit for late strikes which has got them back to the Europa League semis, with former Roma man Patrik Schick scoring three times in added time over their 5-4 last-16 win against Qarabag and two more late goals helping them past West Ham in the quarterfinals.

Coach Alonso said his team’s ability to claw back results at the death was “hard to explain” after Robert Andrich snatched a point at Stuttgart but is hoping it holds out for the rest of the campaign.

“Our main objective was to become champions, but now we don’t want to stop,” added Alonso to Sky.

With chances of qualifying for the 2024 ICC Women T20 World Cup no longer in their hands, Zimbabwe senior women’s cricket team coach Walter Chawaguta is hoping for a miracle to see his charges progress to the semi-finals.

The Lady Chevrons will play Netherlands today in a must-win match to keep their slim chances alive. A defeat would mean that they will miss qualification for the global event for the second consecutive time.

However, Chawaguta has chosen to remain hopeful although admitting that the team made the situation difficult for themselves after losing two games and winning one.

“It is always good to have hope.

“We have made things difficult for ourselves,” said Chawaguta.

Having lost to Vanuatu and Ireland and winning against hosts UAE, Chawaguta feels the tournament has not gone according to their plan.

“We have had some meetings and discussed what needed to be done. One of the things we spoke about is that we have to start well, whether it is with the bat or the ball, but this is not what has happened.

“We have not been good with either the bat or the ball in matches we have lost,” said Chawaguta.

Zimbabwe sits in fourth position in the five-team group. They have two points and an inferior run-rate to Netherlands and UAE, who have the same number of points.

With a scheduled match against Netherlands today, Chawaguta is hoping his charges will get a win and keep their slim chances alive.

“It now depends on other results but first and foremost we have to win our game against the Netherlands. There are quite a few ways this can go (progressing to the semi-finals) and we hope that things go our way.

“And like I said, first and foremost we have to beat the Netherlands as it is the only thing that will keep us in the hunt,” said Chawaguta.

Zimbabwe women’s bowler Loreen Tshuma revealed that the team will concentrate on their match against Netherlands.

“We just need to concentrate on what is controllable and what is controllable is that we play well tomorrow (today) and win our game. We will see what happens from there because there are still other teams that are yet to play. So, the main thing is to win the game,” said Tshuma.

Tshuma, one of the senior players in the Zimbabwe dressing room, has urged her teammates to keep trusting the process and stick to their plans ahead of the last group match.

“I think we need to go through our processes; we have a plan for the game, and I think if we stick to the plan and go through the process everything will come out right,” said Tshuma.

She reckoned that the match against Netherlands will not be an easy task.

“Netherlands are a good side, they play good cricket, and we have to be at our best,” she said.

Tshuma revealed the team was high in confidence despite suffering a defeat on Monday to Ireland which dented their chances of progressing to the last four.

“After the defeat, the morale was down but we came together as a team, and we agreed that we should not allow the result to affect us.

“Because we still have a game to go, we discussed the little things we need to do right and everyone is in the right space for today’s game,” she said.

The top two teams from each of the two groups will progress to semi-finals and the finalists automatically qualify for the ICC T20 World to be hosted by Bangladesh in   October.",https://www.herald.co.zw/lady-chevrons-pray-for-miracle/,The Herald,Lady Chevrons pray for miracle

Mutare Boys High . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5) 5

MUTARE Boys High and Plumtree were yesterday the focal point of the Mwana Group International Schools Rugby festival and the two senior sides did not disappoint as they put on quite a spectacle, albeit in a low-scoring encounter at Prince Edward’s Jubilee field yesterday.

Their respective coaches, Casper Belt Bandi, and Francis Nakamu, were united in their gratitude for the return of the festival and felt their charges could have done better to make full use of the opportunity afforded to them.

For Nakamu, he was left to rue the absence of many of his regular starters and felt his Plumtree unit could have then won by a bigger margin.

“We will take the win, but I was not happy with my boys’ performance,” said Nakamu.

“We play very good rugby but today the guys seemed to be absent and we only got the win through some individual brilliance from one or two players. “We were supposed to have won by a bigger margin but, maybe, I am going to point that to the absence of some of my starters.

“The kids from Plumtree come from all over the country and some of the parents refused to release their children. The only good thing to come out of that was that it allowed some fringe players to showcase their talents.

“Now, we have a bigger base,” he said.

Maybe it was the perfectionist in Nakamu but Plumtree did have their bright moments and in a dominant show. Winger Lawrence Ndlovu was arguably one of the best players on the park and capped off his Player-of-the-Match performance with a brace of tries, either side of half-time, while Iblamu Dumbura put the icing on the cake when planting Plumtree’s third. Mutare found the going tough with Djimburu Manyuchi scoring his side’s only try in the first half.

However, the team seem to be a work in progress as Bandi tried to look on the bright side and chalk off the result as “a learning curve’’.

“Plumtree came out with the right mentality and deservedly won,” he said.

“It was a bad day in the office for us and now we go back to the drawing board to prepare for our next game against Milton.

BULAWAYO Chiefs hitman, Never Rauzhi, is the go-to man when one needs a solid relationship with a broth-er-in-law.

Stallon Dinala, who is married to Rauzhi’s sister, inspired the Ninjas’ front man to become a professional footballer.

Rauzhi recorded the solitary goal, which floored Chegutu Pirates in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League tie at Luveve on Sunday to take his tally to five goals this season.

The 23-year-old is now jointly leading the Golden Boot race with Lynoth Chikuhwa of Highlanders.

Strangely, Rauzhi is giving all the flowers to his brother-in-law for going out of his way to make him believe in what seemed a distant dream.

Dinala is a former footballer who once played for Harare  City’s developmental side in the ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League.

He realised Rauzhi’s potential when he was just 16 and took him to a Division Two side, which is based in Kuwadzana, named Dutch.

That is when Rauzhi realised there was no turning back and he saw the need to make his brother-in-law proud.

“I want to thank my family and friends who have supported my vision from the beginning.

“But I want to thank my brother-in-law for playing a huge role in helping me to become a professional footballer.

“He is the one who took me to Dutch when I was just 16 and playing in Division Two at that age gave me every reason to trust the process,’’ said Rauzhi.

Rauzhi had endured two below-par campaigns before this season.

He made his Premiership breakthrough at Tenax three seasons ago before joining Triangle last year.

His goals were not enough to afford the Chiredzi side any chance to be part of the top-flight league proceedings this campaign.

But, they gave his coach, Thulani Sibanda, all the reasons to bring him on board when he returned to Bulawayo Chiefs.

Rauzhi also told Zimpapers Sports that he is surprised with how the tables have turned for the better in his career this campaign.

“I had offers from other clubs but I chose this team because of the trust which coach, Sibanda had shown me during our time at Triangle.

“I’m surprised with how things have turned out because if you ask me, I wasn’t expecting to be moving with this speed but God has made it possible.

“I have challenged myself to take responsibility for every result of our fixtures and maybe that’s why I’m having this pressure of wanting to score as many times as possible because the ultimate goal is to play for the Warriors,” he said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/rauzhi-owes-it-all-to-brother-in-law/,The Herald,Rauzhi owes it all to brother-in-law
