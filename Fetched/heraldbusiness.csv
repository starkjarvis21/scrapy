President Mnangagwa has hailed the country’s workforce for its immeasurable contributions to economic development, describing its hard work as the backbone of Zimbabwe’s progress.

This comes as the country’s biggest labour union, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), yesterday acknowledged that President Mnangagwa’s “Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo” mantra was people-oriented and resonated with the inclusive Zimbabwe everyone wanted.

Writing on his official X handle on International Workers’ Day yesterday, the President saluted the country’s working class for its sheer determination, hard work, resilience and dedication towards Zimbabwe’s prosperity.

The world yesterday commemorated May Day in celebration of workers’ contributions globally.

“I salute the resilience, dedication and hard work of every worker in Zimbabwe. Your contributions are the backbone of our nation’s progress,” he said.

In his message at State House on Tuesday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was witnessing unprecedented growth across all sectors due to the workforce’s persistence and resolve.

As such, the Second Republic was committed to ushering a conducive environment for the country’s workers.

“We take great pride in our commitment to fostering a thriving and equitable work environment, as evidenced by our recent signing of the decent work country programme with development partners.

“It is through your dedication and perseverance that we are witnessing unprecedented economic growth and development in our country. Tinokutendai. Siyabonga. We thank you.

“Let me reaffirm the Second Republic’s dedication to the well-being and prosperity of all the workers of Zimbabwe.

“Together, in unity, let us continue to strive for a future where every worker is afforded the dignity of decent work, as we continue to build our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” said the President.

President Mnangagwa said his administration would continue to ensure higher standards of living for civil servants as they had a key role to play in the country’s development.

“As we continue to build our country, guided by our philosophy ‘Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo,’ we celebrate the milestones we are realising under the Second Republic.

“We pay tribute to workers in the public sector and recognise the pivotal role they play in ensuring essential service delivery and fostering an environment conducive for national development.

“Hence, my administration is dedicated to improving the welfare of its workers in tandem with economic sustainability. To cushion the workers, Government will continue to provide non-monetary incentives that include duty-free importation of vehicles and subsidised transport for civil servants through the provision of buses to and from work,” he said.

Furthermore, the President acknowledged the diaspora community for their contributions in the country’s economic development. Their contributions were not going unnoticed.

“Meanwhile, I want to recognise and commend our Zimbabwean diaspora, who are working in various jurisdictions across the world. We celebrate you and recognise the contribution you are making to our country’s economy and your families here back home,” he said.

Under the Second Republic, the welfare of workers has continued to be a top priority.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions held its main commemoration at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, with the labour body’s president, Ms Florence Taruvinga, calling on employers to pay wages that were above the poverty datum line.

She urged employers, particularly foreign investors, to ensure better working conditions and to comply with the country’s labour laws.

“The mantra, ‘Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo’, is indeed resonating to the inclusive Zimbabwe that we all want. As workers, we have our demands which we feel, if met, would alleviate the plight of workers.”

The diplomatic community also held a function to join Zimbabweans in celebrating the International Workers’ Day which recognises the historic struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements in many countries.

The Cuban Embassy in Harare yesterday invited its nationals and Zimbabwean friends to celebrate the International Workers’ Day.

Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Yenielys Regueiferos Linares said she was honoured to be celebrating the day in Zimbabwe.

“It is a great honour to celebrate May Day, which is the International Workers Day, in this sister land of Zimbabwe,” she said.

“We have common struggles. Both countries are submitted to unilateral sanctions

and it is extremely important for us not to let history aside. The history of our heroes, those who gave their lives for us to get independence.

“We are celebrating May Day after establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries for the past 44 years. We have participated in several activities, like the burial of the three national heroes on Monday at the Heroes Acre, because for us our history is extremely important.”

Palestinian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Dr Tamer Almassri, said the day called for unity of workers across the world.

“Today turned out to be a solidarity day for all the oppressed people in the world and Palestine as the people who suffered from the last occupation in the 21st century,” he said.

“The International Workers Day in Palestine is a target to the Israeli occupation and we have more than 18 000 workers who were killed by Israeli forces in the ongoing genocide.

Today we show our solidarity with the Cuban people who are suffering from sanctions and also our solidarity with our friends, brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe who are also suffering from the illegal sanctions.

“The Zimbabwean workers are victims of these illegal sanctions and today we want to give them solidarity. Our message to all the oppressed people and the workers in the world is we salute you.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/workers-efforts-hailed/,The Herald,Workers’ efforts hailed,

Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has exposed 11 cases of fake doctors this year alone, as people take advantage of the vastness of the country’s largest referral medical institution to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

The country’s largest referral hospital has recorded a total of 33 cases of fake doctors and other bogus employees in the past year.

Last week, a fake doctor operating at Pari the hospital was caught at a security checkpoint, after producing two identity cards that were different from the name inscribed on his coat.

Across town at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital last week again, another fake doctor was flushed out by the institution after he allegedly exposed himself by holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

Both have since been arrested and taken to court, where they separately await trial.

An upsurge in the number of fake health practitioners has become a cause for concern as it exposes patients and other stakeholders to the danger of getting wrong treatment, while being fleeced of their hard earned cash.

In a statement, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals said it had been rocked by cases of people masquerading as doctors or tutors, among other such employees, as they took advantage of the high number of workers at the country’s biggest hospital.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has always made efforts to safeguard the public from unscrupulous people who masquerade as our employees, with malicious intentions to fleece unsuspecting members of the public.

“In 2023 alone, 33 offenders were picked up by our Security Department. From January 2024 to date, 11 cases of this nature have been picked up by the same department and dealt with accordingly.

“Bogus doctors, bogus tutors who extort prospective student nurses and thieves who steal from both staff members and patients are some of those criminals who have been picked up and handed over to the police,” said the hospital in a statement.

“Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals is a vast institution with close to 400 doctors of all professional levels and a total staff establishment of close to 4 000. Unscrupulous people take advantage of our vastness and complexity to carry out nefarious activities.

“Fortunately, our surveillance teams remain vigilant and have always apprehended these unruly elements who try to penetrate and abuse our systems.”

The hospital assured its stakeholders that it was above the situation as its surveillance team remains vigilant and would not hesitate to flush out those fake staff members.

“We would like to assure members of the public that the investigations carried out by the hospital have established that the three recently arrested fake doctors did not manage any patient.

“Our surveillance teams shall continue to flush out criminals bent on abusing public trust in our institution,” said management of the hospital.

Last week, Blessing Nyanzira (24) appeared before a Harare magistrate facing impersonating charges after he was caught at a security checkpoint with two different identity cards.

He was remanded in custody to today for bail application.

The court heard that last week on Thursday, Claude Nyangani, the loss control supervisor at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, met Nyanzira while he was on patrol during lunch hour.

Nyanzira was putting on a scrub jacket with his name inscribed on it and a stethoscope on his neck.

The court heard Nyangani monitored Nyanzira as he went to the staff exit security checkpoint and produced two identity cards bearing different names.

Nyangani became suspicious and approached Nyanzira. He identified himself as a medical doctor who was going to Harare’s central business district to meet a Dr Ndarukwa.

Nyanzira allegedly supplied Dr Ndarukwa’s mobile number for Nyangani to verify his identity.

When Nyangani called the said doctor, he acknowledged that he knew the accused, but denied that he was a medical doctor.

In another case at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Douglas Garikayi Mutoredzanwa allegedly exposed himself as a fake doctor after he was seen holding an X-ray upside down, analysing it in front of a patient.

President Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the family of renowned historian, retired head of National Museums and Monuments and retired Unesco delegate Professor Dawson Munjeri, whom he accorded a State-assisted funeral following his brilliant work that inspired many.

Prof Munjeri, a specialist in culture and heritage studies, died on Monday after a long illness.

In a statement, the President described Prof Munjeri as an African intellectual of world repute.

“I was deeply touched and saddened to learn of the passing on of Professor Dawson Munjeri on Monday evening, April 29, after a long illness.

“An African intellectual of world repute, as well as an expert in heritage conservation and monitoring, Professor Munjeri had a long and illustrious career which started at the National Archives of Zimbabwe in the late 1970s, before he joined the National Museums and Monuments where he rose to become its executive director from 1993 to 2002,” said President Mnangagwa.

He said for his tremendous contribution, Prof Munjeri had been accorded a State-assisted funeral.

“On behalf of the ruling party, ZANU PF, Government, our community of scholars and researchers, my family and indeed on my behalf, I want to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Munjeri Family, to his children and grandchildren especially.

“May they be consoled by the late departed’s meritorious contribution to our nation, and to greater humanity as an international worker. To that end, Government has seen it fit to accord Professor Munjeri a State-assisted funeral. May our ever-loving God rest him in eternal peace,” he said.

President Mnangagwa chronicled Prof Munjeri’s work saying with his illustrious career, which was also backed by several scholarly publications and peer-reviewed articles, it was not surprising that Professor Munjeri joined UNESCO as a deputy permanent delegate, an assignment which saw him posted abroad to work in the French capital, Paris, from 2002 to 2017.

“The high point of his career came when he became President of the 17th General Assembly of State Parties to UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention which ran from 2009 to 2010 under his able stewardship.

“Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating her national and her home-grown scholar and researcher whose demise this last Monday threw those of us who knew his capabilities as a scholar, and had the privilege of working closely with him, into utter distress,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Our nation has lost one of its choicest sons gifted with rare intellect. Upon retirement from UNESCO, Professor Munjeri came back home to resume his career in the academia and, more broadly, in nation-building.

“He joined the Great Zimbabwe University as a research professor at that institution’s Centre for Cultural Heritage. Alongside that onerous responsibility, he also mentored as a visiting Professor postgraduate students in heritage studies at Midlands State University.”

He said Government relied on his great expertise.

“What makes Professor Munjeri’s passing on most poignant and particularly painful is that he left us at a time when my Government has embarked on many programmes to raise the nation’s consciousness of national and African history through heritage studies, and on a broad-based rehabilitation of historical personages and heritage sites, a thrust exemplified by the recent rehabilitation of the iconic site at Pupu, and of course the ongoing construction of a regional museum dedicated to the celebration of African liberation struggles,” he said.

“Indeed our history and our material culture are key pillars in the reconstruction of our collective identity as Zimbabweans, and in consolidating our sovereign statehood. They must become a material force in our nation-building efforts and transformation towards Vision 2030.”

Prof Munjeri played an instrumental role in the preservation of culture and heritage in Zimbabwe, Africa and numerous other countries across the world.

His interdisciplinary approach and open personality, throughout his professional career and life, inspired numerous heritage practitioners and professionals in the world.

Prof Munjeri’s 53 books and numerous other articles explored oral traditions and oral history, museology; tangible and intangible heritage, legal frameworks on heritage and sustainable development.

He shared his extensive knowledge and passion for heritage with the world at large, contributing to scholarly debate on culture and heritage studies.

Prof Munjeri was born on 11 July 1949. He did secondary education at Fletcher High School in Gweru and later enrolled for a BA Honours History degree at the University of Zimbabwe.",https://www.herald.co.zw/prof-munjeri-gets-state-assisted-funeral/,The Herald,Prof Munjeri gets State-assisted funeral,

As part of the programme to ensure significantly better public health services by 2028, the Government plans to double the health workforce over the next four to five years, from village health worker level all the way to specialist doctors, while retaining the staff already in place.

Over the past decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a massive brain drain which has seen a many of the doctors, nurses and other professionals trained in this country moving to other countries, attracted by better pay.

While a professional core remains, public health services are strained.

Briefing a World Health Organisation headquarters delegation recently, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said Zimbabwe needed to boost its health force across the board.

“We have got about 20 000 village health workers and we have made a decision that we need to increase this to 40 000 by 2028.

“We cannot do it overnight, so we have taken a phased approach. At least when we have 40 000, this will be adequate to cover all our villages,” he said.

Zimbabwe has about 35 000 villages, so the doubling will ensure at least one health worker in every village, with extras that can be deployed in peri-urban settlements, larger villages and even urban areas.

“The second stage is now to say, those who are trained as nurses, doctors, as radiotherapists, all those other specialists, we need to increase the training, double the numbers again by 2028 to be able to meet the demand that we see in our country,” he said.

Minister Mombeshora said it was essential to be able to retain the workforce.

Government was committed to making Zimbabwe an appealing place to work for health workers within the country and to attract some of those who left to come home.

A health labour market analysis conducted by the Health Services Board (now upgraded to the Health Service Commission) in 2022 showed that Zimbabwe, along with Nigeria and South Africa were the leading foreign suppliers of nurses from Africa to the UK alone.

In 2021, the country had more than 2 000 nurses who had been officially registered to practice in the UK with more indicating intentions to migrate. If doctors and other health professionals are added to the mix, the figure for all workers in this sector who migrated to other developed countries was likely to more than double.

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava will today attend the 21st Nordic-African Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The two-day annual meeting will conclude tomorrow under the theme: “Multilateralism and increasing trade and investment.”

It will be attended by several African Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

It provides an opportunity for the African countries to exchange notes with countries of the North on key global issues and developments.

The meeting also serves as the developing mechanism for improving trade and investment between African and Nordic countries, the group of Denmark, which includes the autonomous Faroe Islands and Greenland, plus Finland, again including its autonomous region of Aland Island, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said: “The Nordic-African Foreign Ministers Meeting will include two closed plenary sessions, one on partnerships in the African Century and the second plenary on global governance and international financial architecture.

“In addition, the meeting will have two sessions of separate roundtables each co-chaired by the Ministers from Africa and Nordic countries to discuss the topic peace and security.”

The programme would also include two-panel sessions.

“An Africa-Nordic Youth Panel which will discuss the theme of youth and economic partnerships sees five youth representatives joined by two Foreign Ministers (one from Africa and one from the Nordics).

An Africa-Nordic research-policy roundtable, will discuss economic partnerships in an age of complexity: sustaining peace and fostering prosperity through Africa-Nordic cooperation.

Tomorrow, an African-Nordic business meeting will be held on the sidelines of the foreign ministers meeting aimed at exploring opportunities to strengthen trade and investments between African and Nordic countries.

“Three-panel discussions, comprising African and Nordic Foreign Ministers as well as African and Nordic country trade representatives and business organisations will be held during the business meeting.

“The three panels are a high-level session on increased cooperation and trade; a high-level session on green transition and digitisation and a high-level session on food value chains.”

Minister Shava would use the same opportunity to have bilateral discussions with some of his counterparts both from the Nordic and African countries.

Relations with Nordic countries were cordial until the advent of land reform in 2000, and direct development assistance to Zimbabwe was terminated in line with the European Union (EU) Common Policy.

Following the imposition of illegal EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, the Nordic countries suspended all government-to-government assistance to Zimbabwe, and only provided humanitarian assistance through NGOs and multi-donor trust funds.

However, Minister Shava is expected to keep engaging and re-engaging the formerly hostile nations in line with President Mnangagwa’s mantra of being “a friend to all and an enemy to none” as the country gallops towards achieving Vision 2030.

The late national hero and leader of the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa (ZAOGA), Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, was a visionary leader who valued the empowerment of children through education, Information and Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingimuzi Phuti said this week.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Ezekiel Guti Christian Primary School in Riverside, Chitungwiza, after touring the school as part of preparations for the Ezekiel Guti Day to be commemorated on Saturday, he said: “I am humbled by the vision of our departed hero, Baba Guti, the vision that put the concerns of a human being to reality, the vision that foresaw things that we are beginning to discover today, the importance of taking a child to school, the knowledge that it doesn’t have to be the responsibility of Government alone.

“It’s the responsibility that is more entangled with care and understanding the reason to empower somebody through education that drove him. But apart from that we are really touched by the ahead of time kind of man he was,” he said.

Deputy Minister Phuti said the programme was meant to celebrate the life of an illustrious son of Zimbabwe whose visionary leadership was noticeable not only in Zimbabwe alone but impacted lives around the world.

The ministry has partnered the Ezekiel Guti Primary School to train youths in the use of ICT.

“In honour of the legacy of Baba Guti we decided that we come in with our digital relevance hence that training we have organised in partnership with your administration.

“We hope that the training will not only open up the eyes of our youngsters but will motivate them to pursue other relevant skills from this,” he said.

Archbishop Guti’s widow, Apostle Eunor Guti expressed her gratitude to the Ministry for the partnership.

“I would like to thank the Ministry of ICT for partnering with us and joining the Zaoga family as we celebrate the life and legacy of our father, Professor Guti,” she said.

Business,"May Day may be a fairly quiet holiday but it is a very important one as it concentrates minds on the position of workers within the economy and the need to ensure that their contribution is recognised.

Their rights and expectations are also taken into account.

President Mnangagwa set the tone with his statement on the eve of the public holiday, that the workers are an essential part of the economic growth through their production and productivity, and their importance cannot be minimised. Without the workers there is no production and they are entitled to their fair share of the wealth their efforts produce.

The Government is the largest employer, and runs almost all the essential services that the rest of us need to produce and to work, so as Head of Government he renewed his commitment that conditions of service will be continually improved within the State sector.

There are obvious limits to just how fast remuneration can be raised and the non-monetary benefits can be implemented and increased. We are not going to print money, or even borrow money, to pay civil servants more since that just leads to economic challenges.

But as the economy grows the tax revenue grows and so more can be done each year to improve the conditions of State workers. The Government, within its fiscal discipline that is now so essential, has maintained the percentage of revenue spent on staff, and maintained it as the largest item in the budget, so economic growth automatically means more can be spent.

The commitment by the President not to take State workers for granted and to maintain the policy of continual improvement as the economy grows is, therefore, important. He recognises their essential input and he wants to treat them fairly.

The President also made his appeal to the private sector, which employs considerably more people than the State, even with the growth of self-employment, to again follow a similar policy of continual improvement and making sure that workers are treated fairly and get their fair share of the wealth being created. Again this is the result of a growing economy, growing production and growing investment.

A major plank of President Mnangagwa’s policy is the Vision 2030, pushing Zimbabwe upwards into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. That is not just a mantra, since we have to think about what that journey means.

The only way to have a successful and continuous increase in national wealth is to make sure that everyone benefits.

That in turn increases growth. Even the arch-capitalist Henry Ford grabbed that point early on as he introduced mass production of motor cars. He worked out that he was not going to succeed unless his own very large workforce could afford to buy the cars they made, so he raised wages and was able to pay these through the higher productivity his assembly lines generated as well as the growing stream of revenue from his growing sales. Everything worked together.

The growing number of the self-employed win as well when employers are fair. Those civil servants and private-sector workers spend the money they earn, and spend quite a lot of it on the goods and services that the self-employed provide. So they win and the whole nation together moves forward. In any case, the small businesses become larger and start hiring people, so they need to remember that they must pay their new workers their just dues.

The Government follows this policy by using the small-scale farming sectors to drive rural development. The whole policy is based on the premise that converting subsistence farmers into small commercial farmers creates the wealth that drives rural industrialisation and the growing percentage of rural dwellers who provide the goods and services that the farmers require and want.

In a developed economy a huge majority of rural dwellers are not farmers, but the underlying rural economy is based on farm production, so the Second Republic rural development policy is based on fact and functional theory, not on some pipedream. Vision 2030 is based on the need for the people, as well as the national economy, to be upper middle income.

While the Second Republic has streamlined labour law, to make it easier to understand and implement, it has retained the essential core that workers and employees are human beings who have rights, as well as duties, and has retained the whole gamut of the national employment councils and workers committees that have been so effective in ensuring that employers and employees can negotiate properly and equally. It has strengthened the similar system in State service, so there is a joint negotiating forum.

The national employment councils were created in settler days to benefit the white workers. They were partially extended under the more liberal settler regime of the late 1950s to more of the formal sector, but only started flourishing fully after independence when everyone was included fully in spirit as well as law.

But they need to be used. Some sectors have very strong and effective NECs and not only do employees benefit, but employers have found that they also benefit by having agreements that work and so can be factored into operations. So they make sure that proper and accurate data is available and enforce the NEC decisions.

Some sectors have very weak NECs, the commercial workers especially, and both employers and employees need to upgrade these.  Sometimes past splits give rise to the oddity that workers in the same sector, and even under the same employer, fall under different NECs. Combining them so that the strongest and best represents all workers in a sector makes sense, for both sides.

Labour law is there to create the practical conditions that President Mnangagwa spoke so strongly about, the need for employers and employees to be fair, and for workers to receive their just share of the growing wealth and basically to ensure that workers who fulfil their duties conscientiously are not treated as cogs in a machine but as co-creators of that extra wealth.",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-drivers-of-the-economy-need-recognition-fair-remuneration/,The Herald,,

Zimbabweans should embrace the newly introduced local currency, the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) to ensure the country does not become a supermarket of the region.

This comes as the operationalisation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) gathers momentum.

The US dollar is in the basket of currencies used in Zimbabwe as part of the multi-currency system.

As it stands the use of US dollar dominates local transactions and according to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), Dr John Mushayavanhu, by end of 2023, over 75 percent of local transactions were being conducted in US dollars.

It is, however, feared that the dominance of the US dollar in the local market will attract more regional imports when the AfCFTA is operationalised, rendering Zimbabwe a supermarket for products from the region and beyond.

It is highly anticipated that the use of US dollar will attract more competition locally, given the competitiveness of some regionally sourced goods.

Already history has it that when the country dollarised during the inclusive Government over a decade ago, the country become a dumping ground of old automobiles, ICT materials and some home appliances among other goods, with regional and international traders taking Zimbabwe as a cheap source of US dollars.

Zimbabwe’s production costs have lately been exorbitant, influenced by multiple factors such as high production costs stemming from myriad of factors including high cost of capital, turbulent macroeconomic environment, unavailability and higher electricity prices.

However, the success of the recently introduced ZiG among other intervention measures by the Government, will undoubtedly enhance the local industry’s competitiveness compared to regional peers.

The introduction of the ZiG, a structured currency backed by gold and other precious metals, is expected to be an impetus to the stabilisation of the local economy going forward.

Speaking during the AfCFTA Tariff Offer dissemination workshop convened by the Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) and Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) on Tuesday, economist Dr Reneth Mano, said embracing the local currency would go a long way in improving the local industry’s competitiveness in face of potential cut-throat competition to be caused by the AfCFTA.

“We should be confident in our local currency, because its survival means our survival. If ZiG does not work, our industry also will not survive. The continued use of the US dollar will make us a supermarket economy as soon as this AfCFTA comes into effect.

“Making ZiG work should be the consensus or rallying point if we are serious about making wins in the AfCFTA environment. We should try to deal with our macroeconomic environment and address the difficulties in doing business,” said Dr Mano.

Government has since maintained a tough stance against illegal foreign currency traders and stewards of arbitrage that have been perpetuating a rapid free fall of the local currency before.

According to a survey by CTC, 50 percent of the large companies are not yet ready to compete in the AfCFTA given an albatross around their operations which leaves them with higher priced goods.

Mr Tawanda Katsande of CTC, implored local companies to pull up their socks and produce quality and competitively properly priced goods so that locals do not end up preferring foreign cheap substitutes.

He called upon relevant authorities and the private sector to ensure a workable macroeconomic environment that lessens the cost of doing production locally, particularly some issues to do with availability and affordability of electricity.

“There is going to be increased competition in Zimbabwe because of the US dollar, we are now reluctant about the US dollar while other countries are hungry for it , goods are going to come here even at lower cost so that they access the greenback,” said Mr Katsande.

To be competitive, Mr Katsande said local companies should keep in touch with new technologies for efficient production processes that lessen cost of production.

He said some of the derelict equipment still being used in industry consume a lot of electricity, while there are now alternatives that use lesser and cheaper electricity.

CZI chief economist, Dr Cornelius Dube, said doing business in Zimbabwe is not easy and the macroeconomic environment needed to sorted for local industry to be competitive.

“Cost per unit for our local companies is actually higher compared to regional peers because here someone is using inferior type of technology, capital costs are high.

“About 18 percent of total overheads are just compliance costs. The regulators try to collect as much as they can from the business,” said Dr Dube.

The Competition and Tariff Commission in collaboration with CZI has been conducting awareness workshops on Zimbabwe’s preparedness in terms of the implementation of AfCFTA mainly focusing on tariff offer.",https://www.herald.co.zw/embrace-zig-to-survive-afcfta-competition/,The Herald,Embrace ZiG to survive AfCFTA competition,

The report indicated that the country spent US$719 million on imports, a 1,5 percent decrease on the previous month’s US$729,9 million, while exports at US$534,7 million represented a 17,1 percent decrease on the February figure of US$645 million.

Industrial supplies comprised 91,9 percent of goods exported in March followed by fuels and lubricants at 3,1 percent, consumer goods at 2 percent, as well as food and beverages at 1,6 percent.

The industrial supplies included mainly semi-manufactured gold at 23,6 percent, nickel mattes, 16,1 percent and tobacco, 12,3 percent.

Mineral fuels and mineral oil products (21,4 percent), machinery and mechanical appliances (13 percent), cereals (8,6 percent) and vehicles (8,1 percent) were among the top 10 products imported during the same month.

South Africa (34,6 percent) remained the top export destination for goods from Zimbabwe closely followed by the United Arab Emirates (34,3 percent) and China (10,4 percent).

During the previous month, exports to SA stood at 28,8 percent while to the UAE was 22,5 percent and China 27,5 percent.

Other imports were from Bahrain (3,2 percent), UAE (2,4 percent).

Meanwhile, ZimStat reported that the ZiG consumer price index in April was 100 with the country having introduced the currency during the same month, making it the index reference.

“This means during the month of April 2024, there is no month-on-month and year-on-year inflation rates.

“The month-on-month inflation rates for the ZiG currency will be computed starting in May 2024 and going forward and year-on-year inflation rate will be computed in April 2025 and going forward, according in to the international recommended methods,” ZimStat said.

The month-on-month inflation rate for April 2024 was 0,8 percent, gaining 0,6 percentage points on the March 2024 rate of 4,9 percent, while the year-on-year inflation rate for the month of April 2024, as measured by the all-items Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 3,2 percent.

Animal health management is crucial in small stock farming. As the age-old adage goes, prevention is better than cure.

Therefore, farmers must strive to always keep their livestock healthy and disease-free.

While sheep and goats are generally resilient animals, farmers must be diligent in maintaining their health. Vigilantly monitoring the farming environment and enforcing strict biosecurity measures are essential to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious pathogens.

Healthy animals are essential for maintaining productivity on the farm. When animals fall ill, they not only hinder production targets but also lead to financial losses.

Therefore, it is imperative for farmers to prioritise the well-being of all categories of animals, including bucks and rams, pregnant does and ewes, as well as newborn kids and lamps.

This entails implementing comprehensive measures for parasite control, effective vaccination management, careful environmental management and meticulous record-keeping.

Implementing biosecurity measures on farms is essential for minimising the risk of disease exposure. This not only reduces mortality rates among newborn kids and lambs but also enhances workers’ knowledge and skills in disease prevention and control.

By diligently enforcing biosecurity protocols, farms can create a safer and healthier environment for their livestock, ultimately contributing to improved overall farm productivity and sustainability.

Despite the implementation of effective health management systems, occasional illness in animals remains inevitable due to various internal and external factors.

Timely administration of appropriate veterinary medicine is crucial in mitigating the impact of these illnesses.

Therefore, it is essential that farm workers responsible for animal care are adequately trained to detect signs of illness early, enabling prompt treatment interventions.

Early detection and intervention not only contribute to the well-being of individual animals but also help prevent the spread of diseases within the herd, ultimately safeguarding overall farm productivity and sustainability.

This brings to the forefront the critical question: how to recognise sick animals within the herd? Sick sheep and goats exhibit various symptoms depending on the nature of the illness.

Some of the most common symptoms of a sick animal include fatigue with poor or no appetite, isolation from the rest of the herd, hunched posture, coarse and dull skin, heavy breathing, abnormal body temperature, faeces mixed with blood or mucus, dark yellow urine, slowed physical growth rate, red or watery eyes, elevated palpitations that can be felt by touching the interior side of the hind thigh, and drooling or excessive saliva from the mouth.

Once identified, sick animals should be separated from the rest of the herd and be treated immediately. To do this effectively, farmers and workers responsible for animal care need to have a thorough understanding of the disease and the appropriate medicine to use.

This includes knowing the correct handling procedures for medicines, such as avoiding exposure to direct sunlight and storing them at room temperature. Additionally, they must be aware of the proper dosages, which are often proportional to the animal’s weight. It is critical to always read the manual before administering any animal medicine.

It is crucial for farmers and workers who handle goats to possess comprehensive knowledge about the major diseases affecting sheep and goats, along with their underlying causes.

This understanding enables not only effective treatment but also the implementation of preventive measures, including vaccinations and management interventions.

Among the most common diseases are tick-borne illnesses like heart-water, foot rot, bloating, orf, pneumonia, brucellosis, as well as internal parasites (such as worms and flukes) and external parasites (including ticks and mites).

These diseases can have profound effects on the health, productivity, and profitability of sheep and goat farming.

Therefore, preventive measures such as vaccination, parasite control, biosecurity and sound management practices are indispensable for effectively managing and controlling diseases.

In addition, regular veterinary monitoring and timely treatment of sick animals play crucial roles in preserving the health and well-being of the flock.

Quarantining sick animals from healthy ones is a crucial animal husbandry practice for preventing the spread of disease throughout the entire herd.

Similarly, quarantine procedures should be applied to newly acquired animals being introduced to the herd from external sources.

This practice enables the farmer to closely monitor, document, and treat sick and newly acquired animals before they are allowed into the rest of the herd. Local veterinary offices can offer valuable guidance on appropriate quarantine protocols tailored to specific circumstances.

One of the primary methods to ensure the health of your sheep and goats is by providing them with sufficient and high-quality feed, along with access to clean water.

Additionally, constructing well-ventilated kraals plays a crucial role in safeguarding the animals from adverse weather conditions. Ensuring adequate space within kraals is essential to prevent overcrowding and minimise the risk of respiratory diseases.

Moreover, well-designed kraals and efficient animal handling facilities facilitate easier management during various tasks such as treatment, ear-tagging, or hoof trimming, thereby reducing stress on the animals.

This reduction in stress is particularly important as it can help mitigate the risk of diseases such as pulpy kidney and Pasteurella.

As the world commemorate International Workers’ Day, a call to action has been made to prioritise the welfare and safety of mine workers amid growing concerns about the deplorable working conditions many are forced to endure.

Mr Justice Chinhema, secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Diamond and Allied Minerals Workers Union (ZDAMWU), has expressed deep concern over the working conditions of mine workers, which he described as “modern slavery.”

ZDAMWU represents about 15 000 mine workers, a significant portion of the sector’s formal workforce of 52 000 people.

The sector accounts for Zimbabwe’s 13 percent of the gross domestic product and generate roughly 80 percent of the country’s exports.

Mr Chinhema”s call comes amid growing concerns, not only about working conditions, but also as Zimbabwe and much of southern Africa battle the effects of climate change that threaten lives and livelihoods.

The country faced a serious drought caused by El Niño, and the general well-being of mine workers had not been spared.

“Compatriots, 2024 workers day has come at a moment when mine workers are fighting tooth and nail to reclaim their rights, for a living wage and protection against excessive exploitation,” said Mr Chinhema.

“We are at a critical stage of history where we are not retreating in confronting the mistreatment of workers and believe May Day should not only be an occasion for gatherings, but it should be a day to salute the mine workers for their continued sustenance of the economy and expression of a deep appreciation to them and those who died or have been injured at the work place in mines across the country.

“Mine workers are an important stakeholder in the extraction of mineral resources worldwide, they are the vital cog that drive any economy and Zimbabwe has been one good example.

“This therefore means mine workers welfare should always be a priority. The Government and employers in the sector need to lend an ear to the concerns of the mine workers as much as possible to see that they are addressed not the current situation where workers have been turned into slaves by employers, mine workers have nothing to celebrate on this May Day as they are subjected to poor working conditions and ‘slave wages’ which have thrown them into abject poverty despite being a vital cog in our economy.”

Mr Chinhema noted that some large mines were even failing to pay salaries when due, even when production was stable.

In addition, he said many workers were forced to work long hours in dangerous environments with no guarantee of a permanent job or fair pay. ZDAMWU has called for an end to these exploitative practices and a living wage that reflects the value of the minerals being mined.

The union also wanted to see the National Employment Council (NEC) reformed to better serve the needs of mine workers, and existing safety and health laws enforced.

The union is particularly focused on protecting the rights of female mine workers.

It has since implemented a Gender and Sexual Harassment policy to address these issues in the workplace and communities. Additionally, it is advocating for the ratification of ILO C190, which protects workers from violence and harassment.

“As ZDAMWU we would like to reiterate that mine workers welfare is the reason of our existence.

“As a union we shall be pushing for the implementation of ILO C176 in Zimbabwe and other existing safety and health laws. We need to continue pushing for the criminalisation of deliberate cause of accidents particularly where it is proved that the employer has failed to comply with the safety rules and regulations,” he said.

He said the union was cognisant of the challenges being faced by female mine workers in the country.

“As a union, we would like to reaffirm our commitment to protect the rights of female mine workers. The union is committed to the emancipation of women both at the world of work and outside.

“We have recognised the challenges women face in general and have put measures and programs in place to address such anomalies and emancipation of women workers in particular,” he said.

Campaigns would be rolled at mine level, communities as well as pushing through works council for work place policy on Sexual Harassment, Gender Based Violence in the world of work.

As we push this policy to be adopted across all mines, we will continue to extensively campaign for the ratification of ILO C190 by the government of Zimbabwe through parliament.

Engagement of female parliamentarians has also begun.

Mr Chinhema said ZDAMWU was committed to organising all mines across the country and becoming a stronger voice for mine workers.",https://www.herald.co.zw/mine-workers-decry-poor-working-conditions-as-they-celebrate-may-day/,The Herald,Mine workers decry poor working conditions as they celebrate May Day,

Introduction

Liquidation, which is the winding up of a business, can be voluntary or involuntary.

It is done in terms of the Insolvency Act (Chapter 6:07), “the Insolvency Act” or “the Act”. In this article I consider voluntary liquidation of solvent companies.

Liquidation of a solvent company

Section 10 of the Insolvency Act regulates voluntary liquidation of a solvent company. A solvent company is one that is not financially distressed.

Eligible for voluntary liquidation

According to section 10 (1) a solvent company that is not an external company or foreign company in terms of the Companies and Other Business Entities Act (Chapter 24:31) or “the COBE Act”, or a solvent private business corporation (“PBC”), may be liquidated voluntarily if the company or corporation has adopted a special resolution to be liquidated as a voluntary liquidation by its members.

Liquidation resolution

According to section 10 (2), the resolution must be filed with the Registrar of Companies who must immediately after its registration transmit a copy thereof to the Master of the High Court.

The filing of a liquidation resolution must comply with the procedures set down from time to time by the Registrar of Companies. According to section 10 (8), a voluntary liquidation of a company or PBC by its members commences when the special resolution has been filed in terms of section 10 (2).

Liquidator

In terms of section 10 (6), the nomination of a liquidator in terms of an adopted liquidation resolution in terms of this section (Section 10) is of no force and effect and the Master must appoint a liquidator in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

A liquidator appointed in a voluntary liquidation by members may exercise all powers given by the Insolvency Act to a liquidator:

Without requiring specific order or sanction of the Court.

Subject to any directions given by the shareholders of the company in a general meeting or by the members of a PBC.

Legal status during voluntary liquidation

According to section 10 (9), despite any provision to the contrary in a Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation, Articles of Association, or Shareholders agreement or in the founding statement of a PBC:

The company or PBC remains a juristic person and retains all of its powers as such while it is being liquidated voluntarily.

However, from the commencement of the company or PBC’s liquidation:

It must stop carrying on its business except to the extent required for the beneficial liquidation of the company or PBC, or

All of the powers of the company’s directors or members of the PBC, cease, except to the extent specifically authorised by the liquidator or the shareholders or members in a general meeting.

Conclusion

Liquidation of an insolvent company or PBC may be voluntary or involuntary. A solvent company or PBC may be liquidated through a special resolution of its shareholders or members. It is important to fully understand the formalities required by the Insolvency Act to avoid a legal nullity or fatal non-compliance.

The central business districts (CBD) office space in major urban centres remained depressed during the second half of financial year 2023, with voids expected to worsen, according to analysts’ projections.

This comes as the property market in general continues to experience limited activity, primarily centred around commercial and industrial sales and development.

A market update for the sector for the period under review shows vacancy rates ranged from between 40 percent and 60 percent and projections indicate a potential increase.

According to real estate consultants, Knight Frank Zimbabwe, the subdued performance is driven by corporate relocations from large office spaces to suburban areas.

The relocations have largely resulted in an increase in voids, although budding small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are taking up space, repartitioned into smaller spaces to accommodate their small businesses.

“Demand for CBD office space primarily originates from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking minimal space,” said Knight Frank.

As companies laid off staff due to operational challenges and the Covid-19 pandemic, the employees resorted to start their own businesses mainly apparel, beauty and hair products as well as electronic gadgets retailing.

This boom in the SME sector especially the retail side, has seen landlords repartitioning space into smaller units to meet the rising demand from the SME sector. In Harare’s CBD, big companies like Meikles and Mashonaland Holdings, have repurposed their buildings to accommodate the SME retail sector.

This also comes as the rate of new office development from both institutional and private entities in Zimbabwe remains low, according to Knight Frank.

Notably, The Strand Corporate Office Park stands out as a significant prime office development situated along Borrowdale Road.

Comprising ten subdivisions ranging between 7000 and just over 9,000 square meters, this premier office park commands asking prices of approximately US$125 per square metre.

The transition to predominantly US dollar rentals in the office sector has been slower compared to the residential market, largely influenced by corporate entities, which constitute the majority of players in this sector.

According to the market update report, rental rates in the CBD range from US$6 to US$10 per square metre for office spaces, contingent upon the condition and amenities offered by the respective office premises.

“Overall, the demand for suburban offices continues to thrive, with vacant spaces in these areas being readily leased compared to those in the CBD,” said Knight Frank.

The yield achieved in the CBD remains at 8 percent. Notably, financial institutions and privately-owned firms are driving the construction of new headquarters and leasing properties in suburban locations.

Listed banking group NMB, is one of the institutions that have led this trend, while FCB is also working on the construction of its new headquarters in Borrowdale. Property firm, WestProp Holdings also indicated its board approved the development of a modern headquarters in Borrowdale.

This also comes as businesses shy away from CBD challenges ranging from high traffic congestion, parking space, dirty and smelly alleys, noise and air pollution, the menace from illegal transport operators and vendors and what has been termed the general decay of the CBD.

Suburban offices command monthly rental rates ranging from US$12 to US$15 per square metre.",https://www.herald.co.zw/cbd-office-space-uptake-remains-depressed-knight-frank/,The Herald,CBD office space uptake remains depressed: Knight Frank,

Zimbabwe’s milk production rose 21 percent to 27,3 million litres during the first quarter of 2024 from 22,61 million litres in the same period last year, latest data shows.

It comes as the Zimbabwe Association for Dairy Farmers (ZADF) is expecting reduced feed stocks in the form of roughage (maize silage) and protein sources due to the effects of the El Nino-induced drought, which will affect national milk production and productivity.

Statistics from the Agriculture Ministry’s Dairy Services Department, show that the country’s milk intake by processors went up 21 percent in the first quarter of 2024 to 25,07 million litres from 20,74 million litres in the comparative period.

Retail milk production increased by 19 percent to 2,22 million litres in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 1,86 million litres in the first quarter of 2023.

Average milk output for the period under review stood at 9,1 million litres. In the first quarter of 2023, the country’s average milk output stood at 7,53 million litres.

In March this year, the country’s milk production appreciated by 19 percent to 8,96 million litres, compared to 7,51 million litres in March last year.

At 8,96 million litres, March 2024 milk production was up 2 percent from 8,81 million litres recorded in February this year.

January milk output of 9.52 million litres is the highest so far.

The annual milk requirement stands at about 120 million litres and the country has been supplementing through imports.

Zimbabwe milk production rose nine percent to 99,82 million litres in 2023 from 91,39 million litres in 2022.

However, it was projected to reach 100 million litres, a 7,5 percent increase in milk output when compared with 2022, but slightly below the set target of 103 million litres for 2023.

This surge in production can be attributed to strategic interventions by the government, particularly the implementation of the Presidential Silage Inputs Scheme.

It was designed to enhance the quality and quantity of livestock feed and has played a pivotal role in transforming the dairy landscape. The programme provides farmers with subsidized silage inputs, ensuring a consistent and nutritious diet for dairy cows, ultimately contributing to increased milk yields.

The silage production programme to address viability challenges emanating from high-feed costs as the dairy sector is saddled by huge overhead costs headlined by stockfeed which accounts for 70 percent of the bill.

Success of the silage inputs scheme can be merged with the European Union US$7 million funding facility to Zimbabwe which benefited small-to-medium-scale dairy farmers in the form of 500 in-calf heifers in 2021 under the Transforming Zimbabwe’s Dairy Value Chain project.

This has seen the rising number of dairy cows being actively milked across the country. Currently, approximately 35,000 dairy cows are contributing to the increased production levels, showcasing the tangible results of these agricultural initiatives.

The interventions were part of the country’s Livestock Recovery and Growth Plan, with a deliberate effort on increasing the national dairy herd from 19,000 in 2021 to 40,000 in 2025.",https://www.herald.co.zw/milk-production-rises-21-percent/,The Herald,Milk production rises 21 percent,

Local financial institution, Metbank, has said it is seeking funds from external partners to support its clients through long-term capital financing.

Dr Linda Chipunza, Metbank’s board chairperson, said the institution was looking to support the economy through long term capital support to industry.

“Metbank will continue to engage with all the relevant funding partners in raising long-term capital to support the country’s economic development aspirations,” revealed the chairperson.

Through securing funds from external partners, Metbank aims to inject vital capital into sectors crucial for national development, thereby fostering sustainable economic expansion.

Long-term capital financing offers several distinct advantages to both businesses and the economy at large.

This provides stability and assurance to industries, enabling them to undertake large-scale projects and long-term investments with confidence.

In terms of capitalisation, Dr Chipunza said: “The Bank remained compliant with the revised regulatory minimum capital requirements for commercial banks and is pleased that it has continued to grow its capital base well beyond the minimum thresholds.”

Going forward, the Bank said its capitalisation will continue to be driven through organic growth with any anticipated shortfalls being covered through shareholder injections.

“The operating environment remains challenging but we remain optimistic that the Bank will maintain an upward growth trajectory, anchored by its strong statement of its financial position. In the implementation of the Bank’s strategy for the delivery of unique customer value propositions, innovation and digitalisation remain our core objectives,” she added.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, Metbank reported a historical comprehensive income of $547,8 billion compared to $66,8 billion in the comparative period.

The gains were underpinned by revaluation gains of their investment property portfolio which was a result of decisive strategic actions made by the Bank to hedge the balance sheet against exchange rate and inflationary pressures.

Dr Chipunza said: “The continued local currency depreciation resulted in increased operating costs in the review period.

“The Bank’s focus remained on increasing foreign currency revenue streams through underwriting loans denominated in foreign currency to act as a hedge against exchange rate depreciation and inflation that will also produce long-term, sustainable profitability.”

Metbank has continued to focus on its digitalisation drive in order to enhance customer satisfaction and convenience.

“Operational and financial resilience is of paramount importance to the Bank supported by robust business continuity and succession planning arrangements.

“The Bank’s board of directors therefore remains resolute with the responsibility of protecting the interests of stakeholders,” the chairperson added.",https://www.herald.co.zw/metbank-seeks-external-funds-to-support-clients/,The Herald,Metbank seeks external funds to support clients,
Business,"The country’s GDP growth has averaged 0,3 pc since 2019.

Investors should not dismiss South Africa over its other continental peers as it has strong institutions that can buttress its economy if it focuses on accelerating growth, the head of research at Standard Chartered Bank said.

“With some institutional strength in terms of the debate around fiscal rules, its existing revenue-collection ratios, the South Africa Reserve Bank, which is a major part of the institutional strength of the country, I think there’s still a lot going for South Africa,” Razia Khan said in an interview. “All it needs now is to really focus on how to kick-start growth.”

Africa’s most industrialised economy has been hamstrung by almost daily power cuts, crime and fraying transport networks. To try combat these challenges, the authorities have instituted a number of reforms.

Data from PWC’s Private Business Attractiveness Index suggests that despite the operational challenges, South Africa is becoming a more attractive location for private business, compared to countries in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.

It ranked 23rd out of 33 countries surveyed for the index in 2023, compared with 31st in 2021. Peers — Kenya ranked 32nd and Nigeria came last.

Still, without the growth push, South Africa’s economy is expected to lag other big regional economies that are also implementing reforms. The International Monetary Fund expects its economy to expand 0,9 percent this year, Nigeria’s 3,3 percent and Egypt’s 3 percent.

“South Africa doesn’t have that natural lever to pull — that is suddenly going to shoot the lights out from a growth perspective, and this is where the country does need to try a lot harder, having seen over a decade of growth under-performance,” Khan said.

Its gains and those of Egypt and Nigeria are going to become more critical if the continent wants to reset the Africa growth story, as some of its former superstars flounder, she said.

Among them are Ethiopia — that’s lost lustre after its recent civil conflict and Mozambique, which is battling an insurgency that is impairing its ability to explore its resource wealth.

“China and Airbus have found good common ground together … and this cooperation is really a flagship of the Sino-French relationship.

“We expect that the Chinese market will keep growing and believe in the huge potential in China,” Olivier Malet, CFO of Airbus China, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

“As a partner of China for nearly 40 years, Airbus wants to stay and take part in this growth of aviation,” said Malet.

Growth and evolution have defined Airbus’s history in China since 1994, when the company first established an official presence in the country.

Fourteen years later, in 2008, Airbus opened its first assembly line outside Europe in China’s northern city of Tianjin.

Airbus is currently promoting the A320 series aircraft’s second final assembly line project. “We recently launched the second assembly line in Tianjin,” he said.

“This second assembly line is a sign of the strong relationship between France and China, and it demonstrates that we are quite satisfied with the ecosystem and setup we have established here,” emphasised the CFO.

“We believe these aircraft will be very suitable for the Chinese market.”

Noting that aerospace manufacturing demands stringent quality and reliability requirements, Malet said that “Airbus produced ‘made in China’ is the same as one made in Toulouse, in Hamburg, in Mobile of the United States . . . . And for me, that is very important.”

Today, Airbus China has more than 200 local suppliers under an increasingly sophisticated supply chain ecosystem. The inclusion of Chinese elements in Airbus aircraft is growing. This deep cooperation benefits enterprises and contributes to the high-level development of the Chinese aviation industry.

Malet said addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development are shared global challenges and common goals between China and France, adding that Airbus aims to pioneer sustainable aerospace.

“We want to work with China on flying greener,” he said.

With China being Airbus’s “largest single market,” Malet believes that China’s continuous advancement of high-level opening-up and ongoing improvement of the business environment will bring confidence and opportunities to global enterprises, including Airbus China.

Celebrating the significant milestone of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, he said bilateral economic and trade cooperation, alongside cultural exchanges, is burgeoning between the two countries.

“In recent years, France and China have worked closely on topics like trade, aviation and culture,” said Malet. “We feel very honoured to be part of it and to contribute to this high-quality relationship.”",https://www.herald.co.zw/high-tech-alliance-a-flagship-of-sino-french-relation-airbus-china-cfo/,The Herald,High-tech alliance a ‘flagship’ of Sino-French relation: Airbus China CFO,
Business,"China is making a huge contribution to the fight against climate change by drastically reducing the cost of green energies, a top German executive has said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.

Via scale production, China has driven down costs to such a low level within the space of 10 years that solar power has now become the cheapest energy source, said Herbert Diess, chairman of the supervisory board of Infineon Technologies.

Diess said the reduced price is “a huge benefit”, and that when looking back in a few decades’ time, it will probably be China that has contributed most to tackling climate change.

Like wind and solar power, new energy technologies are expected to become “cheaper by the month” as Chinese automakers intensify competition in the auto market, Diess noted.

He echoed some German automakers by explicitly standing against European Union (EU) measures, which would impose additional import tariffs on Chinese EVs.

This is “the wrong way to go now,” Deiss said, explaining that if one side decides to increase tariffs, the other side will follow suit and cars will become more expensive.

“In the end, European car makers can’t be in favour of import taxes here because it would also hurt them,” he added.

The German auto industry is investing in China because it has become “the new cluster for new energy vehicles,” he underlined.

Not only does China have the largest new energy vehicle market, but also the most competitive auto companies, components manufacturers and cutting-edge technologies such as autonomous driving.

“If you want to be long-term successful, you have to be in China now — and not only for manufacturing. You also have to do R&D in China.”

Meanwhile, Chinese automakers who want to win over the EU market should “become local players, understand the local customer, make a plan over a decade or two, and not expect that in half a year you can win the game,” Deiss said.",https://www.herald.co.zw/china-making-huge-input-to-fight-against-climate-change-german-executive/,The Herald,China making huge input to fight against climate change: German executive,

The market has been generally stable since the announcement of the 2024 Monetary Policy Statement by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu, which introduced the new ZiG currency and is expected to ensure lasting stability, certainty and predictability in the exchange rate and inflation.

In a statement yesterday after a follow-up meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) last Friday, Dr Mushayavanhu said the committee deliberated on the recent macroeconomic and financial developments following the announcement of the monetary policy statement on April 5.

One of the major policies brought by the statement was the introduction of the new ZiG (local currency), backed by gold, other precious minerals and foreign currency reserves.

Dr Mushayavanhu said the MPC noted that the monetary policy statement was “well received by the market”.

“Preliminary indications since the announcement of the MPS show that the markets have been fairly stable,” he said. 

“In this regard, the MPC affirmed its commitment to the consolidation of these positive sentiments and ensure a quick restoration of confidence, trust and anchoring of inflation expectations. 

Dr Mushayavanhu said considering the initial positive reaction from the market, the MPC has resolved to maintain the current bank policy rate at 20 percent a year and an interest rate corridor of 11 percent to 25 percent to maintain the statutory reserve requirements for demand deposits, with savings in ZiG at 15 percent and time deposits at 5 percent, respectively.

Further, the MPC resolved to maintain the statutory reserve requirements for demand deposits and savings and time deposits in foreign currency at 20 percent and 5 percent respectively. 

Dr Mushayavanhu said the MPC will proactively review the monetary policy measures in line with the exchange rate and inflation developments. 

He said to support the tight monetary policy stance, the MPC emphasised the need for the Reserve Bank to continue to work closely with the Government for a robust liquidity management system through the joint Liquidity Management Committee to contain money supply growth to the desired levels determined by targeted inflation, growth of the economy and increase in foreign reserves backing the ZiG currency. 

This cooperation would ensure the creation of effective demand for the domestic currency through strict adherence to the multicurrency system by all in the economy, consistent with the multicurrency system except for exempted services.

The RBZ would work closely with the Government to encourage the increased use of ZiG for payment of goods and services to public entities, including the settling of tax obligations on quarterly payments dates. 

Added Dr Mushayavanhu: “The MPC also directed the Reserve Bank to ensure that there is effective communication on the new structured currency, ZiG, to cover the whole country to ensure that there is financial inclusion. 

“The Reserve Bank was also directed to ensure that, at all times, any growth in reserve money is fully covered by reserves, in the form of gold, other precious minerals and foreign currency balances in the Reserve Bank’s nostro account.”

Overall, the MPC affirmed its strong commitment to fully implement the new monetary policy measures.",https://www.herald.co.zw/monetary-policy-restores-market-stability-certainty/,The Herald,"‘Monetary policy restores market stability, certainty’",

Zimbabwe imported 410 667 tonnes of maize worth US$128 million in the first three months of this year to cover a deficit occasioned by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

The Government has partnered with the private sector to mitigate the effects of the drought.

Figures from the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZimStat) show that the country imported 136 084 tonnes of maize worth US$41,95 million in January. 

This was followed by a further 145 354 tonnes valued at US$43,7 million in February, while US$42,4 million was spent on 129 229 tonnes of maize in March.

The country spent an average of 5,98 percent of its import bill on maize.

The Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) expects to import one million tonnes of grain between now and March 2025.

It is likely that Zimbabwe will spend more on importing grain in the coming months.

Economist Tinevimbo Shava said: “Zimbabwe’s proactive approach to addressing the food deficit through increased maize imports demonstrates a commitment to ensuring food security for its citizens, especially in the face of challenges like the El Nino-induced drought.”

“The Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe’s initiative to import one million tonnes of grain underscores the proactive measures being taken to prevent drought-induced hunger, reflecting a concerted effort to safeguard the well-being of the population.”

President Mnangagwa declared the drought a national disaster in March this year. Malawi and Zambia, Zimbabwe’s neighbours, have also separately declared the drought a State of National Disaster.

El Niño refers to a cycle of warming and cooling events that happens along the equator in the Pacific Ocean, leading to an increase in sea surface temperatures across the Pacific. The warming phase of the phenomenon — El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) stimulates drought conditions. 

ENSO creates both dry and hot conditions that negatively affect food crops. The cooling part of the cycle is called La Niña and has the opposite effect.

Severe drought in Southern Africa left millions in need of relief food. President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe needed US$2 billion to address food security needs for millions of its citizens.

“No Zimbabwean must succumb or die from hunger,” the President told a press conference. “To that end, I do hereby declare a nationwide State of Disaster, due to the El Nino-induced drought.”

He revealed that over 2,7 million people, or around a sixth of the country’s population, did not have adequate access to food this year due to low yields caused by the drought.

The Government granted companies and individuals permission to import maize, rice, and cooking oil — free from duty with effect from July 2024 to avert looming food shortages emanating from El Nino effects.

Economic analyst Namatai Maeresera believes that the collaboration between the Government and the private sector to import maize is a commendable step towards mitigating the effects of the drought and ensuring a stable food supply chain in Zimbabwe.

“The Government’s decision to grant duty-free importation of essential food items like maize, rice and cooking oil demonstrates a responsive approach to addressing looming food shortages, highlighting a commitment to meeting the basic needs of the population during challenging times,” he said.

Other measures taken by the Government to beef up stocks includes the purchase of local grain at an import parity price of US$390 per tonne to mop up excess local grain.

Speaking during a post-Cabinet media briefing in March, the Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Dr Jenfan Muswere said the importation of genetically modified grain would be for stockfeed production.

“The Government has okayed a duty waiver on the importation of rice and potato seed, and the importation of genetically modified maize for stock feed, under strictly supervised milling and distribution,” the Minister stated.

The Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Dr Anxious Masuka added that rice and potatoes would be regarded as key staples to ensure national food security.",https://www.herald.co.zw/zim-imports-410-667t-maize-in-q1/,The Herald,Zim imports 410 667t maize in Q1,

Analysts have projected improved 2024 performance for the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) listed firm — Caledonia Mining Plc, as the resources group addresses some of the setbacks experienced during the prior year.

The group, earlier in March, issued a profit warning, as it projected depressed full-year profitability weighed by increased operating costs at its Gwanda-based Blanket Mine, consisting of higher-than-expected overtime payments and electricity costs.

Caledonia incurred several significant one-offs, non-operating costs during the fourth quarter (Q4) period, which were expected to have a knock-on effect on profitability for the full year to December 31, 2023.

Its fourth quarter saw the commencement of work at its second asset, Bilboes, with operations centred on mining and processing oxides. The oxides project yielded 3 050 ounces of gold at an average grade of 1,13 grade per tonne in the period under review.

Operations were, however, hindered by an unforeseen need for extensive waste, stripping in the relevant areas and inaccurate mineralisation maps, resulting in the project not meeting its expected output of between 12,500 ounces and 17,000 ounces.

As a result, the group’s aggregate gold production for FY23 registered at 78,466 ounces, a 3 percent decline from the 80,775 ounces in the prior comparable year.

While the group experienced these challenges, research firm IH Securities sees better prospects for the resources group.

“Whilst Caledonia experienced significant setbacks in FY23, we foresee alleviation of some key issues in the current year,” said IH Securities.

As per management reports, running costs at Bilboes after it was placed under care and maintenance, have fallen from US$1 million per month to US$0,2 million.

“However, work on the much larger scale Bilboes sulphides project is still ongoing in the background with the existing feasibility study now at an advanced stage,” said the research firm.

Indicative gold production at Blanket Mine for the year has been set at between 74,000 and 78,000 ounces at an on-mine cost and AISC foreseen at an upper range of US$970 and US$1,470 per ounce, respectively.

Electricity costs are notably expected to remain high in the short term and then decrease as older, less efficient infrastructure, gets decommissioned.

Management has also shown optimism that the cost increases experienced in the prior year will not extend into 2024, while year-to-date production and costs at Blanket Mine is within expectations of full-year guidance so far.

Additionally, the resources group is also introducing measures aimed at reducing electricity costs over the medium term.

“A number of the other cost items are not anticipated to be recurring, whereas others have arisen from our decisions to invest in the business, most notably around personnel and advancing the Bilboes sulphide project.

“I am confident that many of these will not recur in 2024, which has started positively and I look forward to the future with optimism, as we pursue our goal of becoming a multi-asset production company,” said group chief executive Mr Mark Learmonth in an earlier communication.

As a result, the group is expected to see an improvement in margins.

“At an average gold price of US$2,226 per ounce, we anticipate that Caledonia will register revenue of US$171 million in FY24.

“Margins are expected to improve in the year, with an EBITDA margin foreseen to firm up to 43,3 percent. 

“Negotiations for the sale of the solar plant are at an advanced stage, which will free up cash flows for core business lines,” expressed IH Securities.",https://www.herald.co.zw/caledonia-projects-better-performance/,The Herald,Caledonia projects better performance,
