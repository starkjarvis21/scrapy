Sports,"It took Alejandro Tabilo just 67 minutes to achieve what other tennis players have unsuccessfully tried to do on countless occasions – beatNovak Djokovic. The Chilean defeated the world No. 1 and top seed 6-2 6-3 in the third round of the Italian Open on Sunday in what was the first meeting between the pair. “It’s incredible. I came on court just looking around and soaking it all in, trying to process everything. I’m trying to wake up right now,” said Tabilo, 26, per the ATP. Djokovic, a six-time champion in Rome, was broken four times by the world No. 32 and has yet to win a title this year. His five double faults were particularly costly. “I was just trying to keep my nerves in, trying to keep swinging,” added Tabilo. “Obviously every time you feel like you are closer to the end, your arms start to get a little tighter and you start to swing shorter, so I was just trying to not think about it and take it point by point. It’s crazy, I can’t believe what just happened.” After losing the first set, Djokovic served up two double faults in the opening game of the second set to gift his opponent a crucial advantage. It was another Djokovic double fault which gave Tabilo his fourth break of the match to secure an incredible victory. Djokovic was accidentallyhit on the head with a water bottlefollowing his second-round win on Friday. He told reporters he “didn’t know” if that incident had impacted his performance. “Training was different,” he said, according to the ATP. “I didn’t feel anything, but I also didn’t feel the same. “Today (Sunday) under high stress, it was quite bad – not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance. Just no coordination. Completely different player from what it was two nights ago. Could be. I don’t know. I have to do medical checkups and see what’s going on.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/novak-djokovic-shock-loss-italian-open-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,Novak Djokovic suffers shock loss as Alejandro Tabilo beats him at the Italian Open in just 67 minutes
Sports,"Manchester Unitedwon the Women’s FA Cup for the first time in its history on Sunday, dismantlingTottenham Hotspur4-0 in front of a sell-out crowd at a sun-soaked Wembley Stadium. The scores remained level for almost the entire first half before Ella Toone gave United the lead with a dazzling goal on the stroke of half-time, and Spurs collapsed in the second half to derail any hope of a comeback. “We are history makers for Manchester United,” the club’s manager Marc Skinner told the BBC. “I didn’t need to remind the owners of that, they know. There is a lot of support and love for our team and the growth. “We want to compete for titles but you all know how important adding that first piece of silverware is. We’ve got nothing but growth ahead.” Sunshine poured down onto the pitch, creating temperatures so hot that there was a drinks break in each half, and it remained even in the early exchanges, both sides not quite able to break down the other’s defense. It seemed that the half would end goalless, that is until Toone created a little magic in its final moments. She evaded Eveliina Summanen’s challenge, wrongfooting and swerving past her, before unleashing a powerful strike from outside the box that curled into the top right-hand corner of the net, past Becky Spencer’s outstretched fingertips. United doubled its lead shortly after halftime, when Rachel Williams rose highest for Katie Zelem’s perfectly weighted free-kick and headed the ball into the net, as she had been threatening to do all game. And the club’s victory was all but confirmed two minutes later as a Tottenham defensive lapse gifted United a third goal when Spencer, attempting to clear the ball, simply passed it to Lucía García who tapped it in for a 3-0 lead. García still had time for a second goal, rifling the ball into the net after Lisa Naalsund had controlled Melvine Malard’s chip into the box, and added some extra gloss to the scoreline.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/manchester-united-fa-cup-tottenham-hotspur-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,Manchester United wins Women’s FA Cup for first time in its history
Sports,"When Lauren Price was eight years old, she wrote down three goals for herself – to become a kickboxing world champion, play internationalsoccerfor Wales and compete at anOlympic Games. For most people, growing up involves making choices, giving up on multiple dreams to concentrate all their energies on a single one, in the hope that perhaps just one, if they are lucky, can be realized. But Lauren Price never had to make that decision. At 12, she was a world kickboxing champion, a title she won another three times. Before she turned 18, she had already played soccer for Wales twice at senior level and another 50 times at under-16, under-17 and under-19 levels, where she captained her team. Soccer and kickboxing were ticked off the list. Then, watching female boxers fight in an Olympic ring for the first time at London 2012 inspired yet another goal for Price, and she took up the sport shortly afterwards, leaving soccer to focus on it. That was the sport that took her to the Olympic Games where, remarkably, she won a gold medal at Tokyo 2020 in the female middleweight division. And, on Saturday, she completed yet another milestone when she became Wales’ first female world champion boxer as she defeated Jessica McCaskill by a unanimous technical decision after the fight in Cardiff, Wales was stopped early on medical advice to treat McCaskill’s injured, swollen eye. “This is just the start,” Price, now the WBA, IBO and Ring Magazine welterweight champion, told broadcaster Sky Sports afterwards. “I want to build a legacy and create greatness … You see what Katie Taylor did for Ireland, I want to do the same for Wales.” But, despite the seemingly seamless realization of all her childhood dreams, Price had to fight hard for them outside the ring as well as inside. When she initially began boxing, Price juggled training with work as a teaching assistant, providing support to a girl with special educational needs, and later as a taxi driver for her grandparents’ company, driving people to and from Cardiff on Friday and Saturday nights. Her grandparents, Linda and Derek, brought her up from the age of three days old. They were the ones to first introduce Price to sport, initially as a way to provide an outlet for all her energy as a child, Linda told The National Lottery, which provides funding to British athletes, in 2021. “They always supported me and told me to believe in my dreams. My nan used to say ‘reach for the moon, if you fall short you’ll land on the stars,’” Price told Sky Sports. “Even now she got me a good luck card and I’ll read that before fight night, it’s just the little things.” Price’s grandfather, Derek, passed away in November 2020, before he could watch her become an Olympic champion and turn into the new boxing “superstar,” as Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom said, per the BBC. “I believe that if you work hard enough and you have got dreams, then you can achieve them,” Price told Sky Sports on Saturday before her world title fight. “I was a kid once and I had three things … I managed to tick all three of them with the love and support of my grandparents.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/lauren-price-world-champion-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,The new boxing ‘superstar’ who played international soccer and juggled training with driving taxis
Sports,"Lionel Messiappeared to cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines when a newMajor League Soccerrule prevented him from immediately returning to the pitch following an injury check. With Inter Miami 2-0 down against Montréal on Saturday, Messi was off the pitch when his team needed someone to take a free-kick. The Argentine had received on-field treatment moments earlier in the first half following a tackle from defender George Campbell, which had led to the free-kick being awarded, and then walked off the pitch. The situation brought the MLS’ “Off-Field Treatment Rule,” introduced in April, into play. According to the rules: “If a player with a suspected injury remains on the ground for more than 15 seconds, the referee will stop play and wave the medical crew onto the field to evaluate the player. “When safe, the player will be removed from the field and remain off the field for a minimum of two minutes for further assessment and treatment.” Unable to return to the pitch, Messi turned towards a television camera on the sidelines, shook his head and said in Spanish: “With these type of rules …” The moment has been widely shared on social media. The 36-year-old was not missed during the free kick, however, as Matías Rojas took it and scored in the top-right corner to reduce the deficit to 2-1, sparking a comeback. Miami eventually celebrated a 3-2 victory, the team’s fifth consecutive league win which extends its unbeaten run to seven games. Luis Suárez and Benjamin Cremaschi were the other scorers on a night when Messi did not find the net. After the match, Miami coach Gerardo Martino told reporters that there were rules that “must be revised.” According to the rule book, the two-minute rule would not have taken effect had Campbell received a yellow or red card for the foul on Messi. “Exceptions to the Off-Field Treatment Rule include instances of potential head injury, goalkeeper injuries, serious medical events, and fouls resulting in yellow or red cards,” the rule states. “In Leo’s situation, he was clearly fouled,” Martino said, per ESPN. “The player deserved a yellow card, which would mean Messi would’ve never left the field for two minutes. “As I understand it, the team that suffered the foul was punished. With these new rule changes, there are situations that must be revised. The infraction was clear and was a yellow card, and ultimately it was us that lost Leo for two minutes.” CNN has contacted the MLS for comment.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/lionel-messi-mls-rule-change-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,Lionel Messi appears unhappy with new MLS rule as he is forced to wait on sidelines before returning to the pitch
Sports,"On May 12, the CNN series “How it Really Happened” will explore the life ofOscar Pistorius,the double-amputee Paralympic and Olympic sprinter who was convicted in the murder of his girlfriend, South African model Reeva Steenkamp, more than a decade ago. Known as the “Blade Runner” for his carbon-fiber prosthetics, Pistorius was once heralded as an inspirational figure At the 2012 London Games, he became the first Paralympian to compete at an Olympics and during his successful track career won eight Paralympic medals, six of them gold. He was in his athletic prime when, on February 14, 2013, he killed Steenkamp. “If you take the celebrity of LeBron James and you combined it with the appeal of Leonardo DiCaprio, that was what Oscar Pistorius was,” said Scott Roder, a crime scene reconstruction expert who worked on the case, in CNN’s documentary, hosted by Jesse L. Martin. The documentary features footage from the court in Pretoria, South Africa, during Pistorius’s 2013 murder trial and 2023 parole hearing and original interviews with Steenkamp’s mother, modeling agent and family attorney. Pistorius shot Steenkamp four times through the bathroom door of his house. In a trial that garnered global attention, he denied killing her in a fit of anger and instead said he had mistaken her for an intruder. He pleaded not guilty to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp’s killing. He was initially convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison before that conviction was overturned and upgraded to murder, increasing his sentence to six years. In 2017, his sentence was increased to 13 years and five months by South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal. The documentary examines the details leading to Steenkamp’s murder – including disagreements between the couple shared over WhatsApp and the athlete’s “obsession” with firearms, though his motives remain unknown to this day. “Why would he kill her? Why did he do it?” Steenkamp’s mother, June, asked in the documentary. She called Pistorius’ version of events “absolute rubbish and lies” and spoke candidly about the pain she felt on that night in 2013. She recalled the moment she was told that her daughter had died, describing it as “the worst day of my life.” “I was hysterical,” she said. “I just wanted to die myself, honestly. I didn’t want to live without her.” The documentary sheds light on the whirlwind romance between the couple and the life of Steenkamp, described by her mother as “a blessing, a gift from God. Very clever, and she was always laughing.” “She would have done amazing things,” said Tania Koen, CEO of the Reeva Steenkamp Foundation. “And she was so kind and passionate and compassionate. The world was a better place with Reeva in it.” Pistorius, now 37 years old, wasreleased on paroleon January 5 this year. A parole board granted his petition in November on the grounds that he had served half of his 13-year sentence for murdering Steenkamp, making him eligible according to South African law. He has kept a low profile since his release, but the conditions of his parole include restrictions on his movements, mandatory classes on gender-based violence, anger management therapy, no alcohol and he’s not allowed to speak to the media. Steenkamp’s mother has been vocal in her criticism of his release and expressed her concern for the safety of other women. “At this time, I am not convinced that Oscar has been rehabilitated,”she saidin a victim impact statement in November 2023. “Rehabilitation requires someone to engage honestly with the full truth of his crime and the consequences thereof. Nobody can claim to have remorse if they are not able to engage fully with the truth. “If someone does not show remorse, they cannot be considered to be rehabilitated. If they are not rehabilitated, their risk of recidivism is high.” “Oscar Pistorius: The Bladerunner” airs on CNN on Sunday, May 12 at 9 p.m. ET/PT",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/oscar-pistorius-cnn-documentary-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,"With Oscar Pistorius released on parole after serving nine years for murdering Reeva Steenkamp, her family still want answers"
Sports,"Like any competitive swimmer, Meghan Cortez-Fields knows how high the stakes can be in a sport where mere hundredths of a second can mean the difference between victory and defeat. But she is among the few who have feared what victory may bring. “I was afraid that if I was able to win, all of my success would be discredited because I was trans,” Cortez-Fields, a senior on the women’s swim team at New Jersey’s Ramapo College, told CNN. As an NCAA competitor, Cortez-Fields underwent more than a year of hormone therapy, blood tests and testosterone tracking to meet the association’s transgender athlete guidelines and achieve her dream of swimming alongside other women. In recent weeks, however, the NCAA has faced a flood of calls to further restrict the participation of trans students after a much smaller athletics association, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), voted toeffectively bantrans women from competing in most of its women’s sports programs. Last month, the NCAA announcedits policyis “under review.” Marshi Smith, the co-founder of the Independent Council on Women’s Sports (ICONS), which fights against trans women’s participation in women’s sports, applauded the NAIA’s ban as a “crucial measure” and called on the NCAA to “release a policy that protects the women’s category.” Critics like Smith argue that transgender women – even those who have undergone treatment to lower their testosterone levels – have unfair physical advantages that would deprive cisgender women of opportunities to succeed. But transgender athletes and their advocates point to a lack of consistent, direct research to support this claim. They say trans women deserve the right to compete alongside their peers. “The idea that trans women are taking over women’s sport is a pretty outside statement given the number of trans women who are competing in the NCAA,” said Anna Baeth, director of research at Athlete Ally, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ equality in sports. Baeth estimates fewer than 40 of the NCAA’s more than 500,000 athletes are known to be transgender. Last month, Athlete Ally sent the NCAA letters signed by more than 400 current and former professional and collegiate athletes, as well as hundreds of researchers and advocacy groups, imploring the organization to continue allowing transgender athletes to compete. “To deny transgender athletes the fundamental right to be who they are, to access the sport they love, and to receive the proven mental and physical health benefits of sport goes against the very principles of the NCAA’s Constitution,” readthe lettersigned by athletes including retired US women’s national soccer team star Megan Rapinoe. “Every single student should have access to the lifesaving power of sports.” Competitive swimming pools have become a battleground in the fight over transgender athletes’ exclusion, exploding into focus when University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas became the first transgender athlete towin an NCAA Division I titlein 2022. Smith, the ICONS co-founder, said watching Thomas compete “was really devastating.” “It’s unfair,” she said. “I felt like I was witnessing women shriveling up.” The NCAA’s policy was revised in 2022 to align “transgender student-athlete participation with the Olympic Movement.” The association takes a sport-by-sport approach, which allows trans players to participate if they have undergone one year of testosterone suppression treatment and meet the testosterone level required by their sport’s national or international governing body. Trans women athletes, including Cortez-Fields, say competing alongside other women is a crucial step toward feeling like their authentic selves and can help combat feelings of isolation. “Trans people have existed since the beginning of time. But we win and it becomes an issue,” she said. For Cortez-Fields, plunging into the muffled echo of the water has always felt like a sacred moment. But that embracing environment became increasingly fraught as she began to express her trans identity during her second season on the men’s team. “Wearing a men’s suit, having to tape my breasts, even just competing against men – it starts to hurt more because it feels like a part of you is dying and wilting away,” she said. “I believed I needed to sacrifice being trans in order to swim.” Cortez-Fields spent more than a year undergoing hormone therapy, meticulously tracking her testosterone levels and trying to train even as her body no longer allowed her to glide through the water with the speed and stamina she once did. Finally, in her senior year, she was cleared by the NCAA to compete on the women’s team, which Cortez-Fields said at the time was “one of the most exciting things that’s ever happened.” She recalls her final meet in February as “one of the best meets of my entire life.” “Every single moment was just magical,” she said. “I just felt like I was literally flying to the water.” During the meet, Cortez-Fields broke two school records and placed 2nd in the 100-yard butterfly – successes she says were scrutinized by anti-trans groups and conservative news outlets but widely celebrated by her teammates. “The majority of the women I have met and swim against, they have celebrated me. They make me feel like I deserve to be there, and I should fight for my place there,” she said. The debate is complicated by a lack of significant research – and scientific consensus – on whether trans athletes, particularly trans women, have an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, even after they have undergone testosterone-reducing therapies. Dr. Joshua Safer, executive director of the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, said many elite sports associations are trying to craft policies without meaningful data on how trans athletes perform in their specific categories, such as soccer or basketball. “If you’re trying to be ‘fair’ – however fair is defined – then you need to look at individual athletic activities directly,” Safer said. “It would be a matter of taking transgender people who participate in sports and looking at them before and after some of their treatments and really measuring differences, especially in common sports.” Such studies may be especially difficult to perform given the relatively small number of trans athletes known to be competing at elite levels. Though research is ongoing, a 2017 review in the journal Sports Medicine found “no direct or consistent research” showing trans people have an advantage. A more recent October 2023reviewconcluded that sex differences do develop following puberty, but many are “reduced, if not erased, over time by gender affirming hormone therapy.”  Qualities such as height and limb length appear to be “less malleable,” the study said, though it pointed out that there are no efforts to restrict cisgender athletes who are exceptionally gifted physically. Until more data is available, Safer believes governing bodies like the NCAA should be wary of enacting sweeping restrictions so that “we don’t get ahead of ourselves.” “Associations should err on the side of being cautious and inclusive until data indicates that there may be an advantage, and then they can make adjustments,” he said. In the absence of a scientific consensus, both sides have argued their case by invoking Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. Trans advocacy organizations remain hopeful that President Joe Biden’s administration will follow through on itsproposal last yearto revise Title IX to bar schools from enacting bans on transgender athletes. “Title IX is really the only major legislation at the federal level that protects cisgender women athletes, and we do believe that should apply to trans athletes,” said Baeth with Athlete Ally. “We want Title IX to consider gender, not just sex assigned at birth.” Any direct mention of trans athletes was notably missing, however, from the Biden administration’s changes to Title IX last month, whichexpanded protectionsfor LGBTQ students. Before the new changes were announced, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that the process of reviewing the trans sports protections is “ongoing.” But some cisgender athletes and conservative lawmakers see the inclusion of trans women in women’s sports as a striking violation of Title IX’s nondiscrimination rule. In March,more than a dozencurrent and former collegiate female athletes sued the NCAA over its transgender participation policy and accused the organization of a “radical departure from Title IX’s original meaning” by allowing trans women to compete against cisgender women. Their outcry was echoed last month by more than a dozen Republican lawmakers who wrote ina letterto NCAA president Charlie Baker that they believe transgender women’s participation will deprive cisgender women “of a fair opportunity to compete and achieve athletic success.” Republican lawmakers at the state and local level have largely driven the push to bar trans people from competing in sports aligning with their gender identity, and their efforts have not been confined to elite competition. Restrictions against trans players have spread across Little League baseball diamonds, high school soccer fields and into the halls of state legislatures nationwide. At least 25 states have laws or regulations in place that ban transgender students, particularly trans women and girls, from participating on the team that aligns with their gender identity, according to theMovement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that tracks such legislation. Cortez-Fields says that while the bans are not surprising, she fears the impact they’ll have on many trans children who may already be struggling to overcome feelings of isolation. “Part of gender affirming care, in a sense, is being able to compete on the team of your gender and with fellow people of your gender,” she said. “It’s such a small minority, but that minority does matter, and they deserve their fair participation as well.” CNN’s DJ Judd contributed to this report.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/naia-ncaa-transgender-ban-sports/index.html,CNN,A college athletics association banned transgender women from women’s sports.
