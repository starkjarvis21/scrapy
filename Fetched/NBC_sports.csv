Sports,"WBC middleweight boxing champion Jermall Charlo was arrested and charged with three misdemeanors of driving while intoxicated, eluding and fleeing from police and leaving the scene of a crash that involved more than $200 in damage, police in Pearland, Texas, told NBC News on Tuesday. Charlo was arrested Monday night at 12799 Broadway St. in Pearland, a suburb of Houston. Officers arrived after the collision and witnessed a verbal altercation between the two parties, police spokesperson Chad Rogers said. Charlo fled in his Lamborghini and refused to pull over. Police eventually boxed him in and arrested him. His blood alcohol content was greater than 0.15%. The legal limit in Texas is .08%.  Charlo, 33, was taken to the Brazoria County Jail and released after he posted a $9,500 surety bond. Charlo is one of the top boxers in the world. He is 33-0 coming off a unanimous decision win against José Benavidez Jr. in a catchweight fight — a fight with an agreed-upon weight limit between two divisions — in November. He has not defended his middleweight belt since he defeated Juan Macias Montiel by unanimous decision in June 2021.  Charlo had been expected to face Mexican superstar Canelo Alvarez in September, but the fight fell through. His identical twin brother, WBC, WBA (Super) and IBF light middleweight champion Jermell Charno (35-2), stepped in and lost by unanimous decision.  Greg Rosenstein is the sports editor for NBC News Digital.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/boxing-champion-jermall-charlo-arrested-charged-dwi-collision-rcna151174,NBC,Boxing champion Jermall Charlo arrested and charged with DWI following collision
Sports,"Diego Maradona’s Golden Ball trophy from the 1986 World Cup has resurfaced. The award, which had been missing for decades, will be auctioned in Paris next month, the Aguttes house said Tuesday. Maradona,   at age 60, was awarded the trophy for his scintillating play at the tournament, where he captained Argentina in its 3-2 win over West Germany in the final in Mexico City. Before that, he scored the controversial “Hand of God” goal and the “Goal of the Century” in a 2-1 win over England in the quarterfinals. The auction house said it expects the trophy “to fetch millions due to its uniqueness.” Maradona received the award — given to the tournament’s best player — at a ceremony at the Lido cabaret on the Champs-Élysées in 1986. It subsequently disappeared, giving rise to rumors. Some say it was lost during a wild poker game, or sold to pay off debts, Aguttes said. Others said Maradona had stored it in a safe in a Naples bank that was robbed by local gangsters in 1989, when he played in the Italian league. According to the story told by a reformed member of the mafia, the trophy was then melted down into gold pieces. “A far-fetched theory, given that it was made of a gold-copper alloy,” Aguttes said in its auction catalogue. Aguttes said the trophy reappeared in 2016 among other lots that were acquired from a private collection at auction in Paris. “It was thoroughly investigated and authenticated as Diego Maradona’s Adidas Golden Ball trophy,” Aguttes said. The “Hand of God” goal came when Maradona punched the ball into England’s net for his team’s opener. Maradona was also a magician with the ball at his feet and four minutes later, he weaved through England’s midfield and defense and then past goalkeeper Peter Shilton for what FIFA later declared the greatest goal in World Cup history. “To say that this World Cup had it all would be an understatement ... it was also, and above all, the tournament where Diego Maradona really showed the world what he could do with his feet, and even with his hands,” said François Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes. Bidders will be asked to make a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000) to participate in the June 6 auction.

Sports,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A Malaysian international footballer has been splashed by acid and two other top players were attacked within a week by unknown assailants, in a rare outbreak of violence targeting athletes in the country. Police criminal investigation chief Mohamad Shuhaily Mohamad Zain said Wednesday that there were similarities in the three attacks and that the victims appeared to have been targeted. But investigators have not determined whether the cases were linked. Faisal Halim, who plays as a winger for the national team and Malaysian club Selangor, was hospitalized with fourth-degree burns following an acid attack by two assailants at a shopping mall on Sunday. He was reported to be in critical but stable condition, with limited movement and speech. Just three days earlier, another prominent national team player, Akhyar Rashid, was assaulted in a robbery outside his house in eastern Terengganu state after his return from training. He was hit with an iron rod, leaving him head and leg injuries. His attackers fled after taking money from him. Late Tuesday, former national team captain Safiq Rahim was tailed by two assailants on a motorbike after a training session in southern Johor state. They later threatened him with a hammer and smashed his car’s rear window but he was not physically hurt. “Our investigations also showed that the players involved were tailed prior to the attacks. The perpetrators also worked in pairs in all the attacks,” Shuhaily, the investigation chief, was quoted as saying by English-language daily The Star. Two people were initially detained over Faisal’s attack, but one was later released. Shuhaily said police were studying the possibility that the attacks could be linked to a recent letter sent to the Malaysian soccer federation (FAM) accusing it of mismanagement of funds, bribery and fraud. However, the country’s anti-graft agency has found those accusations baseless. Police urged professional footballers to be vigilant while the investigation is ongoing, while FAM has suggested that star players consider hiring bodyguards. The Selangor club has launched a solidarity campaign for Faisal, while Safiq’s Johor team has boosted the security of its players.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/malaysian-soccer-player-was-splashed-acid-rcna151216,NBC,A Malaysian soccer player was splashed with acid the same week two other athletes were attacked
Sports,"Netflix’s   had viewers doubled over in laughter. It also got Jason Kelce and his brother, Travis Kelce, thinking about who they would want to roast them if the opportunity presented itself. “If I was picking who to roast me, I would pick people that like I would have no problem getting into a fistfight with, like family members,” Jason Kelce said on the May 8 episode of their  . However, he drew the line at one person very close to him — his wife,  . “The one person I wouldn’t allow on the stage is Kylie because she knows way too much,” he said. “Cannot allow that.” “I mean, every day I’m getting roasted by Kylie. I don’t need her to go up on stage and do that,” he added. Travis Kelce, meanwhile, had a list of people that’d he be more than willing to fire zingers at him. “Well, Santino’s one of my favorite comedians of all time and I think he would f------ deliver,” he said, possibly referring to Andrew Santino, who   on “New Heights.” “Dave Chappelle is the all-time great.

I wasn’t able to actually watch it live,” Travis Kelce continued. “But I tell you this man, I commend everybody because nobody seemed to get their feelings hurt.

Sports,"A northern Idaho prosecutor won’t bring hate crime charges against an 18-year-old accused of during the NCAA Tournament. The deputy attorney for the city of Coeur d’Alene made the announcement on Monday, writing in a charging decision document that though the use of the slur was “detestable” and “incredibly offensive,” there wasn’t evidence suggesting that the man was threatening physical harm to the women or to their property. That means the conduct is protected by the First Amendment and can’t be charged under Idaho’s malicious harassment law, Ryan Hunter wrote. The members of the University of Utah basketball team were staying at a Coeur d’Alene hotel in March as they competed at the NCAA Tournament in nearby Spokane, Washington. Team members were walking from a hotel to a restaurant when they said a truck drove up and the driver yelled a racist slur at the group. After the team left the restaurant, the same driver returned and was “reinforced by others,” revving their engines and yelling again at the players, said Tony Stewart, an official with the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, during a news conference shortly after the event. The encounters were so disturbing that they left the group concerned about their safety, Utah coach Lynne Roberts said a few days later. Far-right extremists have maintained a presence in the region for years. In 2018, at least nine hate groups operated in the region of Spokane and northern Idaho, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. “We had several instances of some kind of racial hate crimes toward our program and (it was) incredibly upsetting for all of us,” Roberts said. “In our world, in athletics and in university settings, it’s shocking. There’s so much diversity on a college campus and so you’re just not exposed to that very often.” University of Utah officials declined to comment about the prosecutor’s decision on Wednesday. In the document detailing the decision, Hunter said police interviewed nearly two dozen witnesses and pored over hours of surveillance video. Several credible witnesses described a racist slur being hurled at the group as they walked to dinner, but their descriptions of the vehicle and the person who shouted the slur varied, and police weren’t able to hear any audio of the yelling on the surveillance tapes. There also wasn’t any evidence to connect the encounter before the team arrived at the restaurant with what happened as they left, Hunter, wrote. Still, police were able to identify the occupants of a silver passenger vehicle involved in the second encounter, and one of them — an 18-year-old high school student — reportedly confessed to shouting a slur and an obscene statement at the group, Hunter said. Prosecutors considered whether to bring three possible charges against the man — malicious harassment, disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace — but decided they didn’t have enough evidence to support any of the three charges. That’s because Idaho’s hate crime law only makes racial harassment a crime if it is done with the intent to either threaten or cause physical harm to a person or to their property. The man who shouted the slur told police he did it because he thought it would be funny, Hunter wrote. “Setting aside the rank absurdity of that claim and the abjectly disgusting thought process required to believe it would be humorous to say something that abhorrent,” it undermines the premise that the man had the specific intent to intimidate and harass, Hunter wrote. The hateful speech also didn’t meet the requirements of Idaho’s disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace laws, which are mainly about when and where noise or unruly behavior occurs. The slurs were shouted on a busy thoroughfare during the early evening hours, and so the noise level wasn’t unusual for that time and place. Hunter wrote that his office shares in the outrage sparked by the man’s “abhorrently racist and misogynistic statement, and we join in unequivocally condemning that statement and the use of a racial slur in this case, or in any circumstance. However that cannot, under current law, form the basis for criminal prosecution in this case.” The Associated Press",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/no-hate-crime-charges-filed-man-yelled-racist-slurs-utah-womens-basket-rcna151332,NBC,No hate crime charges filed against man who yelled racist slurs at Utah women’s basketball team
Sports,"WNBA star and Olympian Brittney Griner writes that she felt she was being used as a “pawn” by Russian President Vladimir Putin when she was arrested and imprisoned just weeks before he invaded Ukraine in 2022. The Phoenix Mercury star’s memoir “Coming Home,” which debuted Tuesday at No. 1 on Amazon’s best-sellers list, lays out in detail the events leading up to her arrest, the challenges of her nearly 10-month detainment in some of Russia’s most notorious penal colonies, the agony of waiting to be released — and so much more, all in 300 pages. In one section, she describes the experience of being a Black gay woman in a Russian prison under Putin.  “Black lives matter,” Griner wrote. “We hear that in the streets, but what is a Black life really worth? Judging by our history, it seems not much, and even less if you’re gay. For Putin, my worth was as a pawn. My arrest gave him leverage in his clash with the West. He was well aware of America’s long history of racial tensions, and he knew how to use that to his benefit.” In February 2022, Griner traveled to Russia to play her eighth season in the country’s women’s basketball league. She was arrested after two vials of cannabis oil, totaling less than a gram, were found in her luggage at the airport in Moscow. She pleaded guilty to drug charges and was   to nine years in prison.  Griner wrote that she was distressed about having disappointed her closely knit family and Black people in general.  When the news of her arrest broke, Griner wrote: “I cried because I’d let down my father. The Griner name was now stained around the globe: dopehead, drug dealer, dumb. I hurt because I knew I’d handed the world a weapon. When you’re Black, your behavior is never just about you. It’s about your entire community.”  Though she said she wears her Blackness with pride, Griner said she felt as though her actions “shamed my people.” “Blackness doesn’t make you less, but it does frame your life,” she wrote. “When you walk into a room, so does race. Frankly, it shows up before you do. It colors every conversation, shapes how you’re viewed, determines whether you’re even heard. From the day you get here, Blackness hangs over everything, from comments about your hair (‘Can I touch it?’) to mentions that certain Black people are ‘smart’ (’cause it’s assumed we’re idiots). The message comes through loud and clear: You’re not one of us, you’re less.” It was so bad that Griner  in the early days of incarceration. She wrote that she’d spend her nights “listing ways I could end my misery.” She thought better of it. And after many sleepless nights, she stopped caring about the freezing temperatures, that her long legs dangled off the mattress and that the bed springs poked into her body. “I was a legit zombie,” she said.   By the time Griner was allowed to shower there, she was shocked at the repulsive conditions, but knew she had to get in the water.  “In the WNBA, my teammates and I joked about the prison showers — a big space with spouts spread around. This was the real thing,” she wrote. “It was nasty, exposed pipes on every wall. Long hair strands all over the tile floor and gathered in the drains. A bloody tampon was tucked between two pipes. As much as I was disgusted by the scene, I was just as repulsed by my stench.” Correctional Colony No. 1, also known as IK-1, is a former orphanage converted into a prison about 50 miles from Moscow, which would take about two hours to drive in Russia’s notorious traffic. Griner had spent the time being transported there handcuffed, with her 6-foot-9 frame folded in the back of a vehicle not equipped for someone her height. She was also deeply afraid, not knowing what to expect, but knowing that where she was headed was no place anyone would want to be. When there, she received myriad instructions before making it to the shower.  “I undressed and found the cleanest part of the floor,” she wrote. “I turned the faucet on, and rusty brown water came spouting out.” Once she got over the color, “hot water felt so good on my skin. I closed my eyes tight, trying to forget where I was. I thought of Relle [her wife] and home and all I had left behind. Down the water slid from my dreads onto the floor splashing away the hell I endured. I stayed in there a good 30 minutes until I banged on the door for the guard to let me out. That was the nastiest shower I’d ever taken. It was also the best.” She wrote about her increased fear when transferred to an even more notorious labor camp, Correctional Colony No. 2 or IK-2, 300 miles east of Moscow. It was known for “horrid conditions, hard labor and inmate torture,” Griner wrote. And temperatures that dipped to 5 below zero.  “When I entered IK-2, I flipped a switch in my head.  , I told myself.” She worked all day, making military uniforms, shoveling snow, breaking up ice.  At IK-2, “I had been frozen, sick, got my hair chopped off. The girl I was lay on a heap of dreads on a concrete floor. … At a labor camp in Russia in the dead of winter, I learned how tough I was.”  Tough, but battered. The experience left her with bouts of “depression, with long stretches of silence and heartache.” One thing that helped her push through the depression and realities of incarceration, she said, were the uplifting letters from family and friends, as well as the mail she received from strangers. Now that she’s returned to the U.S., she’s back to playing for the Mercury. She’s also seeing a therapist.  The Biden administration negotiated a trade for : Griner would be released in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, known as the “Merchant of Death.” Before freedom, she experienced one last humiliation: Russian guards ordering her to strip naked as they took photos.  “I didn’t cover my privates, nor did I cower or tremble,” she wrote. “I sense they expected me to fall apart. ... I stood tall. . . I felt like weeping, but I had no tears left.”  She wrote that she keeps one remaining vow: “I will not rest until Paul Whelan is released,” she said of the former Marine who has been detained in Russia since 2018 on accusations of spying. The U.S. denies the charges.

Sports,"Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player on Wednesday.  Jokic, who also took home the honor in 2021 and 2022, is just the ninth player in league history to claim three MVP awards. The only others since 1990: Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  The Serbian big man averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9 assists a game this season while shooting 58.3% from the field.  Jokic, 29, got 79 first-place votes, while fellow finalists Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks got 15 and four, respectively.  Jokic is one of the most unusual players ever to compete in the NBA. At 6-foot-11 and 284 pounds, he has the size, length and strength to back opponents down in the post but also a soft shooting touch to hit from midrange and outside the arc. He also has exceptional ball-handling and passing ability for a center, making him the quintessential modern big man. He finished the 2023-24 season fifth in total points, third in total rebounds, second in total assists and eighth in total steals. Jokic is the only player in NBA history to rank in the top 10 in all four categories in a single season since the league began keeping statistics on steals in 1973-74.  The Nuggets — the defending NBA champions — finished the regular season second in the Western Conference behind the Thunder. Denver is down 0-2 in its postseason series with the Minnesota Timberwolves.  “There are a lot of players that deserve it,” Jokic said on TNT after the announcement. “It’s probably the details and small things … but we lost two games at home to Minnesota. Tomorrow we leave to [go to] Minnesota to try to get the series back to Denver.” Shaquille O’Neal said on the broadcast that Gilgeous-Alexander deserved the honor. He averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 assists and 5.5 rebounds while leading Oklahoma City to the best record in the conference.  “I don’t like to rain on people’s parades, but I’m not happy with this one. ... I felt Shai Gilgeous-Alexander deserved it,” he said. “I know this is going to be hurtful for him.

Sports,"INDIANAPOLIS — Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they’ve opened an investigation into an “NBA player and citizen” altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Bucks guard  in the final minutes of   to the Pacers. Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives, “who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.” Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office at the conclusion of the investigation, the release stated. Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands, hitting a fan in the head with about 2 ½ minutes left in the game on May 2. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator. Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of “The Pat Bev Podcast” that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he’d never been called before, but added that his own actions were “still inexcusable.” “I will be better,” he said. “I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened. Simple as that.” Beverley added the atmosphere in Indiana “was great” aside from “a handful of fans” who crossed the line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98, eliminating Milwaukee from the playoffs. “I ain’t bringing a basketball on the bench no more,” Beverley said. “That … threw my whole vibe off.” After the game, Beverley wouldn’t allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn’t subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face and then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle. On his podcast Wednesday, Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that “it was never my intent to disrespect you.” A day after the loss, Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley’s behavior was “not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.” “We’re better than that,” Rivers said. “Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally — this is an emotional game and things happen — unfortunately, you’re judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/milwaukee-bucks-patrick-beverley-police-investigating-rcna151400,NBC,Police investigating after Milwaukee Bucks player Patrick Beverley threw ball at fan

Mizuhara was an employee of Ohtani's former team, the Los Angeles Angels, but Ohtani ""paid him separately for the additional work of driving him to meetings and interpreting for non-baseball-related activities,"" prosecutors said.
