Entertainment,"Switzerland and the Netherlands, two of the favorite's to win  , secured spots in Saturday’s grand final alongside   despite   and booing during its performance. Some 100,000 visitors have gathered in the southern Swedish city of Malmo for the annual kitsch-fest, under heavy police presence as authorities brace for possible unrest. Swiss rapper and singer Nemo, 24, qualified from the second semi-final on Thursday with the song ‘The Code,’ as did Joost Klein, 26, of the Netherlands with his song ‘Europapa.’ “Singing this song in front of a live audience and knowing that so many people are listening made me really emotional,” Nemo said during a news conference following the semi-final. The song, a drum-and-bass, opera, rap, and rock tune, is about Nemo’s journey of self-discovery as a non-binary person. “I think it’s really important that we have so much queer representation this year,” Nemo said, referring to Irish contestants Bambie Thug, who also secured a spot in the final after performing in the first semi-final on Tuesday. Israeli solo artist Eden Golan, 20, and her song ‘Hurricane’ also qualified for Saturday’s grand show, which will feature performances from 26 countries. Some booing was heard from the crowd before, during and after Golan’s performance but also applause and Israeli flags waving, according to a Reuters journalist in the auditorium. “I’m so overwhelmed with emotions,” Golan later told the news conference. “It’s truly such an honor to be here on stage performing and showing our voice and representing us with pride,” she said, adding the organizers had taken precautions to make the event safe for everyone. The solo artist characterizes her song as a strong power ballad that describes a person going through a storm of emotions. Armenia, Austria, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Latvia and Norway also qualified for the final. Eurovision organizers had resisted calls to exclude Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, arguing that the competition is a non-political event. More than 10,000 pro-Palestinian campaigners, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, staged a non-violent protest in the hours ahead of the semi-final, waiving Palestinian flags and shouting “boycott Israel”. A smaller group of pro-Israeli supporters, including members of Malmo’s Jewish community, also staged a peaceful demonstration in the city, defending Golan and her nation’s right to take part in the contest. Hundreds of artists in Sweden and elsewhere have pushed for Israel to be blocked from taking part, as did two Belgian government ministers earlier this year. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the event, requested earlier this year that Israel tweak its initial lyrics in order to participate, saying they had originally made reference to the Oct. 7 attack. In a video statement earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation. “You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism — and representing the State of Israel with enormous honor,” Netanyahu said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-secures-spot-eurovision-grand-final-protests-rcna151613,NBC,Israel secures spot in Eurovision grand final despite protests
Entertainment,"A popular Twitch streamer and YouTube personality who was charged with inciting a riot last year after a New York City giveaway  will not be prosecuted, the prosecutor’s office said. Kai Cenat and two others have already paid more than $57,000 and Cenat publicly apologized after the event in Union Square Park went disastrously wrong on Aug. 4, a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said Tuesday. The event was not permitted or sanctioned by the city. Cenat, a video game streamer, made promises that he’d give away video game consoles, PCs, gaming chairs and keyboards, among other highly sought-after items. Hundreds attended. Police said bottles, rocks and fireworks were thrown, aerial video showed people standing on cars, and the NYPD said three officers were injured after police were attacked and in the crush of people. “The total restitution of $57,099 covers the landscaping damage and additional staff hours needed for clean-up,” the Manhattan DA’s office said. “All of the restitution payments have already been made.” Cenat, now 22, himself paid $55,000 to the Union Square Partnership under the deal, the district attorney’s office said. He posted an apology on social media Tuesday in which he admitted he created “an unintentional dangerous situation due to the way I promoted and advertised it.” “I am from NY and would never want to see the city turned upside down due to unwanted, irresponsible, and dangerous behavior,” Cenat wrote. “I wanted to do something cool and fun for people and did not think it was going to turn into something that caused harm to the city, and I should have thought more about the post before I announced it,” he wrote. The NYPD arrested Cenat on charges of riot, inciting to riot and unlawful assembly.

Entertainment,"Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Thursday signed into law a bill that aims to protect consumers from ticket scalpers and resellers. The legislation is the latest to combat unfair ticketing practices, an issue that has   since the sale of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour tickets in 2022. A Minnesota bill named after Swift was  , requiring ticket price transparency and prohibiting resellers from offering the same ticket more than once.  The bill was first introduced in January by state Sens. Dawn Gile, Brian Feldman, Pamela Beidle and Arthur Ellis.  In a phone interview, Gile said that the bill will create a ""fairer landscape"" for consumers and prevent them from getting ""tricked into paying more than what they should be paying."" ""There was a lot of attention on this bill, and I think it's because people are just so outraged by how expensive tickets are,"" Gile said. Resellers will be prohibited from selling speculative tickets, which are tickets that are not currently in the seller’s possession.  Resellers will also be required to disclose the total price of a ticket, including taxes and fees. They must also issue refunds to ticket purchasers if a ticket turns out to be counterfeit, if the event is canceled or if the ticket does not match what was advertised. The law goes into effect on July 1. Maryland will become the first state to fine resellers and platforms that offer speculative tickets. Moore said in a statement that the law will “help lower costs” for Maryland residents hoping to enjoy live events in the state’s venues. “Resale markets have put rapidly rising costs on consumers and this will help our state protect people from unnecessary price hikes,” Moore said.  Similar legislation has been proposed on a federal level but has yet to move past committee.  The Fans First Act, introduced in December by a bipartisan group of senators, also seeks to ban the sale of speculative tickets and prohibit other deceptive ticketing practices.  Last month,  , including Billie Eilish, Green Day and Chappell Roan, signed a letter in support of the legislation.  “We are joining together to say that the current system is broken: predatory resellers and secondary platforms engage in deceptive ticketing practices to inflate ticket prices and deprive fans of the chance to see their favorite artists at a fair price,"" the letter read.

UmaSofia Srivastava, 17, posted on  : After careful consideration, I’ve decided to resign as I find that my personal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization.” Srivastava added: “I am grateful for all the support from my family, my state directors, my sister queens, and the fans who have cheered me on since I won my state title. I will always look back on my time as Miss NJ Teen USA fondly, and the experience of representing my state as a first generation, Mexican-Indian American at the national level was fulfilling in itself.” The resignation comes the same week Noelia Voigt relinquished her crown as Miss USA, citing her mental health.  Last week, the social media director for the Miss USA organization also announced she was resigning. Claudia Michelle said   she had observed Voigt’s mental health “decline” and observed “disrespect” to Srivastava and her family. ""I feel the way current management speaks about their titleholders is unprofessional and inappropriate; I disavow workplace toxicity and bullying of any kind,"" Michelle wrote. Laylah Rose, CEO and president of the Miss USA organization, said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday that “the well-being of all individuals associated with Miss USA is my top priority.” “All along, my personal goal as the head of this organization has been to inspire women to always create new dreams, have the courage to explore it all, and continue to preserve integrity along the way. I hold myself to these same high standards and I take these allegations seriously,” she said, without elaborating on what allegations she was referencing. Srivastava said she will continue to advocate for education and acceptance. She cited the response she has received, from both children and adults, about a children’s book she wrote, “The White Jaguar,” as having forged her legacy. “This work has always been my TRUE purpose,” Srivastava wrote. According to a  , it’s a story about a jaguar that is separated from her parents during a fire.

Voigt announced on Monday she was resigning as Miss USA to prioritize her mental health. Voigt, 24, who captured the crown in September, posted on   that she was stepping down. “Deep down I know that this is just the beginning of a new chapter for me, and my hope is that I continue to inspire others to remain steadfast, prioritize your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice, and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain,” Voigt said. The Miss USA organization said in a statement on Monday that it respects Voigt’s decision and has accepted her resignation. “We respect and support former Miss USA Noelia Voigt’s decision to step down from her duties,” it said. “The well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time.” The pageant said it is reviewing plans for “the transition of responsibilities to a successor” and will make an announcement soon.

Entertainment,"There’s a sour, green drink hack taking over Sonic, and fans of the mixed beverage have helped it go viral online calling it the perfect sip. On May 1, TikTok user Mississippi Memaw (@mississippimemaw) shared a   of her ordering a pickle-filled Dr Pepper at the drive-through of her local Sonic. The video generated 3.8 million views and brought attention to a regional beverage remix that’s been bubbling under the radar. “Do y’all like pickles? Do y’all like Dr Pepper? Well come on with Memaw, cause Memaw’s fitting to show you something,” the TikToker states in her video.  After patiently waiting in the drive-through, a restaurant worker takes Memaw’s order of a large Dr Pepper with pickles. Missing from the exchange is what some might expect to be confusion, although the worker does say she has to charge the customization by marking it down as cherries. The TikToker breezily gets her drink order, paying $3.62 for the concoction.  “Alright I done put my straw in my cup, but let’s see what it looks like,” Memaw says, showing off the floating dill pickle slices in her soda pop. “Don’t knock it till you try it. If you like pickles and you like Dr Pepper, and you’re probably like ‘Ew gross, I would never ever drink that,’ but there’s a lot of people that do drink this,” Memaw says, stirring the pickles further into her drink. “Did you hear her, the way she took my order? I’m not the only person that’s ever ordered this, babe.” Finishing the video by enjoying a long sip of the drink, Memaw encourages her viewers to try it for themselves. “It’s really good. Y’all should try it.” Memaw’s short and sweet video seems to have struck a nerve, with nearly 6,500 comments talking about the flavor combination. “me and 2 year old tried it today!! new favorite,” wrote one commenter. “I got to try this at home bc the way my sonic would call the police on me 😬😮‍💨,” wrote another. “I’ve been drinking dr pepper with pickles since the late 80s,” someone already aware of the beverage chimed in. “But it has to be Best Maid dill!!” Referring to the Sonic employee, someone wrote, “I love how she isn’t even phased 🤣👏,” to which Memaw replied, “Nope 🤣.” Some people who say they are current and former Sonic employees shared their experiences as well. “This was the strangest order I ever remember getting when I worked at Sonic in high school. 🤣,” wrote one user. “I have worked for Sonic for over 20+ years and I have never gotten a customer that has ordered a pickle Dr Pepper,” wrote another, with someone else adding, “it’s probably a regional thing that’s common to order.” Since Memaw’s video went viral, it   are  . Some are   and   on the platform, garnering thousands of views themselves. There are so many people interested in the briny beverage that a Sonic worker — who spoke to TODAY.com and asked to be referred to as Macy —   to express confusion at the sudden uptick. “I’ve had three people order pickles in their Dr Pepper today what is happening,” reads an on-screen caption on the video, which had 1.1 million views at the time of reporting. Sonic confirmed to TODAY.com it has noticed more orders of what it’s calling a “Dr. Pepper Pucker.” “With thousands of unique ways to customize your drink at SONIC, we are no stranger to seeing our fans create fun and unexpected flavor combinations,” a Sonic representative tells TODAY.com.  “The addition of pickle slices was a new one though, and we’ve seen an increase in guests adding them to their drinks over the past week,” the rep continues. “While the ‘Dr. Pepper Pucker’ is not an official drink on SONIC’s menu, we appreciate and encourage the creativity. And who knows… if your drink innovation is popular enough, it might just end up on our menu!” A representative for Keurig Dr Pepper tells TODAY.com that while the team isn’t aware of any pickle-flavored drinks in the brand’s history, it’s something they’re keeping the door open for. “With regards to future flavors, we always explore new flavors and trends and love that Dr Pepper fans always find a way to make it their own,” the rep says. I am a giant Dr Pepper fan — in fact, it’s my preferred soda. I’m also fond of pickles. but the Dr Pepper Pucker seemed very strange to me. Still, as someone who has   with open arms, I had to give this flavor combination a taste. Admittedly, I tried this with ingredients I had at home as my closest Sonic is nearly an hour away. My first thought when I learned about the drink was, “People are just doing anything these days, huh.” But then, I tried it. And, reader, I didn’t hate it! I   thought I would, but then I remembered some of my favorite cocktails are greatly improved with the addition of a  .  In this drink, the briny nature of the pickles adds a little something extra to the sweet and fruity flavors of a Dr Pepper. I drank the whole thing and imagined I would love to add a shot of whiskey while enjoying a rack of barbecue ribs this summer. The original TikToker, who asked to be referred to as Memaw to protect her identity, says while she has indeed inspired tons of folks to put pickles in their Dr Pepper, she wants to stress she didn’t originate the drink. “It has been around for a long time,” Memaw tells TODAY.com. “I’m not gatekeeping it and I didn’t invent it.” Memaw adds she first learned about the drink roughly nine years ago when her daughter asked her to pick one up from Sonic. She tried it and the rest is history. “My daughter at the time was 16. She’s 25 now, and she’s the one that got me to try it for the very first time,” Memaw says. The creator points to folks mentioning theNorth Carolina What-A-Burger drink called a   — a mix of soda fountain flavors, pickle juice, pickle slices and a lemon wedge — as another variation of this not-so-new idea, and a Reddit user   back in 2021. “… it’s sick and wrong… but part of me wants to try it…” one commenter on Reddit  . Macy, who also went viral, says their restaurant in Tennessee has seen a constant influx of orders for the drink since Memaw’s video.  “I haven’t tried it yet, but my coworkers said it’s actually kind of good,” Macy tells TODAY.com. “I still wouldn’t say it’s common, but a lot of people have tried it or at least asked about it now.” Memaw says while she’s glad people are responding well to the video, she’s just going about her life with her four children and five grandchildren, noting that no one in her town is batting an eye at her viral fame. “I didn’t expect it to go viral,” she says. “If I did, I would have at least washed my hair, you know,” she adds with a laugh. “I had it up on a clip and I was like, ah well.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/reason-many-people-are-putting-pickles-dr-pepper-right-now-tastes-rcna151566,NBC,The reason so many people are putting pickles in Dr Pepper right now — and how it tastes
Entertainment,"A woman who claims to be the inspiration for the stalker character of Martha in “Baby Reindeer” said the popular Netflix show was “defamatory” and called much of the plot a “work of fiction.” Comedian Richard Gadd created and starred in the series, which follows his character, Donny, as he navigates being stalked by an older woman named Martha (played by Jessica Gunning). Though Gadd said the story is based on his true personal experiences, he has   that the character Martha is not meant to resemble her real-life counterpart. But after the show’s popularity boomed, many online began speculating around the real Martha’s identity. The theorizing got so intense that, by late April, Gadd had posted an Instagram story   with their unsubstantiated guesswork. In the  , uploaded to his YouTube page Thursday, Fiona Harvey, 58, said she was “forced” to come forward about her experience after internet sleuths began harassing her online.   The show has “taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online, people phoning me up,” Harvey said. “It’s been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn’t give credence to something like that, and it’s not really my kind of drama.” Harvey said neither Netflix nor Gadd contacted her about the show, which she also said she has not watched. She said she “absolutely” plans to take legal action against Gadd and Netflix. A spokesperson for Gadd and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.  Gadd’s Netflix series was adapted from his one-man show, which  . It’s described on Gadd’s website as a “chilling personal narrative exploring obsession, delusion, and the aftermath of a chance encounter.” Gadd previously   that the show went to “such great lengths to disguise [his stalker] to the point that I don’t think she would recognize herself.”  Watching the show, viewers are met with a message that flashes on screen that reads, “This is a true story.” Later, when the credits roll, the text reads: “This program is based on real events: however certain characters, names, incidents, locations, and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.” In her interview, Harvey disputed several of the incidents and details depicted on the show. She said she met Gadd when she visited a London pub for a meal. Unlike in the show, she said, Gadd never offered her a cup of tea. She said she never caught Gadd looking through her window, heckled his comedy show or attacked his girlfriend. Harvey also said that she did not know where he lived and that she never visited his house, nor did she contact his parents. “That’s completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me. Very career damaging, and I wanted to report that completely on this show. I’m not a stalker. I’ve not been to jail,” Harvey said. “This is just complete nonsense.” Morgan grilled Harvey about the emails, voice messages, tweets, Facebook messages and letters Martha sent Donny on the show. Harvey said she sent Gadd a handful of emails, tweeted him about 18 times and wrote him one letter. She said she never texted him or messaged him on Facebook. Asked about the show’s title — a moniker that Martha gave Donny — Harvey said she did own a baby reindeer toy as a child. She said her joke mentioning it to Gadd inadvertently gave the show its name. Harvey could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Morgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The saga comes amid increased attention surrounding the show and fans’ impulse to “ .” Experts have told NBC News that the desire to sleuth, which has become commonplace on the internet, is a symptom of the internet’s   and its  . Aside from trying to identify real-life Martha, viewers were also trying to pin down Gadd’s real-life inspiration for the character Darrien, a TV comedy writer who sexually assaults Donny. Many online soon began to accuse British actor, writer and director Sean Foley of being real-life Darrien, without real evidence. Foley   that he had called upon the police to investigate viewers’ “defamatory abusive and threatening” posts against him. For Harvey, Gadd’s Instagram statement did little to quell the harassment. “Saying ‘don’t speculate,’ wow, that’s a bit rich now, isn’t it? Fans do speculate,” Harvey told Morgan. “Wednesday, The Daily Mail got in touch with me, so that was all over BBC breaking news Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.” During a panel discussion Tuesday at a screening in Los Angeles, Gadd   that he never viewed his stalker as a villain, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  “I think I struggle with a toxic empathy problem,” Gadd said. “I remember when I was getting stalked, it was relentless and felt like it was everywhere, and I felt like my life wasn’t really functioning. I still had these unbelievable pangs of feeling sorry for her.” Harvey told Morgan that she was not under the impression that Gadd ever felt sorry for her. “I think he’s psychotic, and I think that anyone going along, being in that play and doing this to somebody, I find the behavior outrageous,” she said, later adding that she “should never have gone in that bar.” Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/baby-reindeer-alleged-martha-speaks-out-piers-morgan-rcna151585,NBC,Woman who allegedly inspired stalker character in 'Baby Reindeer' says show was 'defamatory'
Entertainment,"Taylor Swift fans from North America are going the extra mile — literally. The pop star   the 18-city European leg of her “Eras Tour” on Thursday in Paris, where she was joined in the París La Défense Arena by thousands of American Swifties who flew overseas to see her. Thursday’s concert introduced a new setlist that reordered certain eras — including by moving “Red” up to earlier in the night — and combining the “Evermore” and “Folklore” eras, according to social media users who posted from the concert. She  . More than a quarter of tickets for the four Paris shows this weekend were purchased by Americans, according to Frédéric Longuépée, CEO of the París La Défense Arena. Tickets for the venue’s shows all sold in under an hour, he added. “To the best of my understanding, a lot of Americans chose to come to Paris to attend this show and obviously visit our beautiful city,” said Longuépée, who estimated “something like 25–30%” of the crowd would be Americans, “which is big.” Kennedy Smith, 21, skipped her college graduation to fly with her mother, Kathleen Smith, 56, from Texas to Paris to attend Swift’s concert instead. Kathleen Smith said getting to see the singer was “nothing short of a miracle” — the pair stayed up all night in hopes of securing tickets, which cost them around $1,500 each. The two were first in line Wednesday to purchase merchandise at the venue, walking away with two bags full of Swift-themed gear. Her daughter called the experience the “trip of a lifetime.” “This is my graduation-from-college gift at Texas A&M,” she said. “And I’ve always wanted to come to Europe. ... And then to be seeing Taylor Swift, it’s just a dream come true.” Securing tickets for the North American “Eras Tour” initially   that the Senate Judiciary Committee   criticizing Ticketmaster’s “monopoly” after the platform   in November 2022 amid overwhelming demand. Some fans had reported that their invite codes failed to work, while others said they abruptly lost the tickets they had already placed in their cart. The chaos, which garnered a response  , led Ticketmaster to offer some scorned fans   at buying tickets. The saga continued last year when Ticketmaster   for the “Eras Tour” shows in Paris and Lyon, after the website crashed amid technical glitches and hourslong wait times plaguing the more than 700,000 fans in the queue. Zoe McCormack, a Canadian fan who  , said she managed to get tickets the following week for multiple nights in Paris, where she now lives. She said her non-VIP tickets here cost €190 each, or about $205, making them more affordable than U.S. tickets. Many tickets for Swift’s shows in Europe cost only a fraction of what tickets cost for her U.S. dates, making them more financially accessible for North American fans who either failed to secure tickets in the U.S. last year or found prices too exorbitant. Some resale tickets sold for tens of thousands of dollars. “I’m so happy that she came to Paris, especially since she has that ‘Paris’ song. I’ve been waiting for this moment ever since I moved to Paris,” McCormack said. “I’m so excited to be here. I can’t believe that it’s already here because we got the tickets almost a year ago. So it’s been a whole year of anticipation, getting the costumes ready, getting our bracelets ready.” Traveling to see concerts abroad is not a new phenomenon, as buying tickets for concerts in the U.S. has become an increasingly competitive and highly expensive ordeal for fans of popular artists such as Swift,   and  . Many American fans of Beyoncé also opted to see her “Renaissance World Tour”  . Swift’s next stop, in Stockholm, expects to see about 10,000 American attendees, Stockholm Chamber of Commerce Chief Economist Carl Bergqvist  . Airlines have also added extra flights from bordering Nordic countries, he added. The pop star was lauded last year by the U.S. Federal Reserve and several municipal governments for   as “The Eras Tour” boosted tourism revenue nationwide. Europe may experience the same effect, as Bergqvist said Stockholm’s 40,000 hotel rooms are sold out for Swift’s three tour dates there, and that “Eras Tour” concertgoers are expected to inject around 500 million Swedish krona, or more than $46 million, into the local economy.

Entertainment,"It’s easier to change an   lyric than it is to change a tattoo of it — and that’s exactly what the singer vowed to do for fan Grace Flemming. Flemming, 20, first heard Rodrigo’s song “Hope Ur OK” in 2021, when the three-time Grammy-winning singer released it on her album “Sour.” She immediately “knew” she wanted a tattoo of one of the lyrics, “address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings,” the Colorado resident tells TODAY.com. She finally got the ink last month on her waist, only to later discover that it incorrectly read “butterwings” instead of “butterfly wings.” Flemming  , encouraging people to double check spellings before getting tattoos. Flemming is emotional in the video that now has more than a million views. In the caption, she asks Rodrigo to change the lyric so her tattoo is correct. “I’m literally crying over my nails right now,” she says in the viral video. The “Vampire” singer left a comment May 6 saying Flemming’s tattoo was the new lyric. “HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH OMG THIS IS THE NEW LYRIC IM CHANGING IT TO BUTTERWINGS,” Rodrigo wrote. Flemming says she can’t believe Rodrigo saw the video, let alone responded. Now, she doesn’t know if she’ll take up the tattoo artist’s offer to fix the tattoo so it matches the original lyric. “Not changing it definitely makes it more unique and special. I kind of want to keep it, but also want to get the right lyrics. Maybe I’ll keep this one, and get the   lyrics somewhere else,” she says. The lyric is her favorite of Rodrigo’s, Flemming says. She has long admired how caterpillars turn into butterflies. “Everybody already has their own wounds or holes. So I take the (line), ‘Address the letters to the holes of my butterfly wings,’ (to say) if somebody’s gonna say something mean, they can say it to me. But, it’s just gonna go through me. It’s gonna go through that hole,” she says. She toyed around with actually getting the tattoo for three years. Once her mind was made up, though, it only took her a week to plan the design. Flemming asked her tattoo artist to stitch together words Rodrigo had previously written in letters and emails sent to fans so the tattoo would appear to be in the singer’s handwriting. “I have loved Olivia since 2015. It was so exciting to have a piece of my favorite artist on me,” she says. Flemming admits she didn’t fully read the text when the tattoo artist showed her the stencil. “I’m such a person who’s like, ‘I want to see the finished product. Just do it. It looks great. I can’t wait,’” she says. She left the parlor joyful and unaware of the error. Then, she then sent a picture to her boyfriend, who immediately noticed the typo. “The little bubbles were typing for so long. And I was like, ‘What is he going to say? Does he think it looks bad? What is it?’” she says. He finally responded, “Did you take out the ‘fly’?” Flemming says she “just stared at his text,” thinking, “There is no way.” She went to sleep and woke up the next day assuming it was just a dream, she says. But it wasn’t a dream. In the month since getting the tattoo, Flemming says she has encountered an array of reactions. People have called her “stupid” for not actually reading the stencil. She shrugs those comments off, saying most people she encounters don’t even notice the mistake until she points it out. Her mom, who does not like any of her five tattoos, has used the mix-up to bolster her case of why she “shouldn’t get tattoos.” She’s learned to embrace the error. “Sometimes I get a little angry about it. But it’s so funny. I tell random strangers who are like, ‘I like your tattoo,’ and I’m like, ‘Oh, well let me show you,” she says. “It’s kind of become such a big thing where I’m kind of like, ‘Oh, this is a really good mistake.’”",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/olivia-rodrigo-responds-fan-got-lyric-tattooed-major-typo-rcna151325,NBC,Olivia Rodrigo responds to fan who got a lyric tattooed with a major typo
