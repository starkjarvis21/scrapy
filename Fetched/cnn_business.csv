A new study from credit reporting agency TransUnion found those in their early 20s are earning less, have more debt and see higher delinquency rates than Millennials did at their age. The findings outline the credit usage of 22 to 24 year old Gen Zers. Millennials who fell in that age range in 2013 were asked about their credit usage during that period. Gen Zers are defined as those born between 1995 and 2012, and Millennials as those born between 1980 and 1994. Gen Zers, like Millennials, have had to deal with economic calamities early in their careers. For Gen Z, it was the Covid-19 pandemic. For Millennials, it was the global financial crisis. But the current generation of early 20-somethings have another challenge: sticky inflation that’s driven up prices of everything from gas at the pump to food at the grocery store. Interest rates perched at a 23-year high have also hiked borrowing rates for auto loans, student loans and mortgages. This isn’t a problem completely unique to early-career consumers. The entire US credit economy has seen higher debt levels and delinquencies across most credit products. A separate TransUnion report found that Americans’ total credit card balance topped $1 trillion for the first time in 2023. But because Gen Zers are early in their credit journeys, it is important for them to establish healthy habits now that will help them down the road, experts say. Before the Bell spoke with Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion, to discuss Gen Zers’ financial situation and what they can do to improve it. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Why are we seeing that Gen Z is tapping into their credit more than their Millennial counterparts 10 years ago? If you think about prices and the cost of living, a lot of what we’ve seen elevated are the things that Gen Z are most likely going to be spending a good portion of their income on. Rent being a huge piece, and we’ve seen double digit increases in rents over the last several years. But even things like food, dining out, gas prices, prices for automobiles and transportation. All of those have seen significant increases. Most Gen Z consumers are not homeowners. They’re renters or living with family or friends. But in those cases where they’re renters, they’re seeing that additional bite that certainly those homeowners that have their homes prior to 2022 haven’t faced. You own your home, your mortgage typically doesn’t vary, but your rent does. And so I think that’s been a big cause of what’s been driving a lot of that financial strain that Gen Z consumers have seen. Do you have any advice for Gen Zers who may find themselves in a difficult financial situation? One of those things that consumers need to realize is, yes, not everybody has the means to pay off their credit cards in full every month. But the cycle of continuing to spend on your credit cards and just paying off the minimums will create opportunities for you to continue to accumulate debt. And it’s going to take a very long time to pay off your credit card balances just paying the minimums every month, particularly if you continue to use those cards. So, understanding what you can afford, what you can spend on (is important). In some cases, consumers have very high debt levels. The opportunity to refinance credit card debt with a less expensive form of debt. Personal loans are a good option for that. You’re forced to make a material payment every month, and consumers can consolidate their credit card debt onto a cheaper form. Over a course of a couple of years, they can pay that off. The key is to not use the personal loans to pay off credit card debt and then run your credit card bills right back up after you do that. Is it fair to say that there is cause for concern when it comes to Gen Z’s financial health, but the situation is more of a wait-and-see than a crisis? I think that’s a very correct assessment. Again, we’ve seen that average credit card balances per consumer, are, even inflation adjusted, 26% higher than they were for Millennials a decade ago. So this is a consumer that has increasingly turned to debt. But even with the higher delinquency levels that we’re seeing, we don’t think that this is necessarily a cause for alarm. Certainly with Gen Z consumers, they are potentially at a stage in their careers where they may see fairly material and rapid salary increases as they go from that first job, either get promoted or take on (other) roles within their organizations or look for new jobs where they have increased earnings opportunities. But at the same time … make sure that again, you’re borrowing and spending within your means. The United Kingdom has come out of a short and shallow recession, giving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak a sorely needed boost ahead of an election expected later this year, report my colleagues Hanna Ziady and Anna Cooban. Gross domestic product grew 0.6% in the first three months of the year compared with the previous quarter, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed Friday. The increase follows falls of 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 0.1% in the third quarter of last year. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. The expansion early this year was driven by “widespread growth” in the dominant service sector, where output ticked up 0.7% during the quarter after dipping late last year, the ONS said. According to projections published Thursday, the Bank of England now expects UK GDP to grow 0.5% this year, double the pace it forecast in February. By comparison, last year, GDP increased by a measly 0.1%. There are other signs the economy’s prospects are brightening. In April, combined output in manufacturing and services recorded the strongest rise in almost a year, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global. Again, service firms drove the expansion. However, compared with its peers, the UK economy is faring less well. Read more here.

business,"Wedding dress shopping may never go back to what it used to be. Instead of collecting your entire bridal entourage to spend a few hours at a boutique trying on several dresses for the perfect find at a lofty price of a $1,000 or more, some retailers are offering to make the wedding dress hunt as easy breezy as buying a T-shirt off the rack. Taking their cue from Millennials and Gen Zers who are turning stuffy traditions on their head and marking life’s milestones moments — such as weddings — intheir own pared down way, a string of affordable fashion brands have jumped into the weddings industry to appease thrifty shoppers with inexpensive bridal wear. Abercrombie, Forever 21, Boot Barn, Shein and Lulus, better known for their tank tops, shorts, ripped jeans, bikinis, cowboy boots and sparkly dresses tailor-made for Beyoncé and Taylor Swift concertgoers, are trying to dress brides for much less. Related articleGen Z is getting married. Together with Millennials, they’re putting their own spin on weddings The move isn’t a complete headscratcher. For one, it allows these mass-market brands to get their slice of the more than $100 billion US wedding industry, according to The Knot Worldwide, a wedding planning and vendor marketplace. “These companies see bridal as a natural extension of their business given that they are already present in many of these product categories,” said Janine Stichter, managing director and consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst with global financial services and market research firm BTIG. Plus, many of their core customers are older GenZers and younger Millennials who are in the sweet spot age demographic for getting married and attending weddings, she said. “The move into wedding wear makes senseso long as it’s not a distraction from their core business,” Stichter said. Teen favorite label Abercrombie & Fitch — which has undergone amajor metamorphosisby shedding its overtly sexualized marketing strategy of the past to more on-trend, age-appropriate and parent-approved clothing — is continuingits evolution, by going after brides. The retailer in March launched the A&F Wedding Shop, a collection of more than 100 pieces for brides, the bridal party and wedding guests, all priced from $80 to $150. Beyond dresses, the collection includes items such as bikinis, pajamas and skirts for other events tied to the wedding. “Our customers live for the long weekend, and when we asked them about their exciting upcoming getaways, we heard so many of them speak about wedding weekends, wedding-adjacent occasions, and the all-important question of what to wear, which this collection is perfectly designed to answer,” Carey Collins Krug, chief marketing officer of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., said in a statement announcing the launch. In April, fast-fashion brand Forever 21 debuted itsfirst bridal collection, priced from $9 to about $50. The clothing includes dresses, sleepwear, accessories, such as a wedding-ready cowboy hat with a veil affixed to it. A white strapless satin and lace midi dress from its bridal shop has a pricetag of $24.29, while another altar-ready white split-hem halter midi dress will set a bride back only $27. That’s a basement bargain compared to the average  wedding dress cost last year of$2,000. California-based trendy fashion chain Lulus has also got in on the act by opening its first bridal boutique, with dresses ranging from $100 to $270, in Los Angeles in February. “At Lulus, brides won’t have to compromise. Attaining that luxurious look without breaking their budgets isn’t a dream, it’s a reality,” Crystal Landsem, Lulus CEO, said in a statement in February. The standalone bridal boutique builds on Lulus’ 2019 entry into wedding wear and “enables the brand to offer its customer-first online experience to brides in real life,” the retailer said in a press release. That’s a smart move, said Allyson Rees, a senior insight strategist at trend forecasting and analytics firm WGSN, in an interview with CNN. “For these bridal collections to land with Gen Z, It’s important that these brands tap into the way that Gen Z shops. Gen Z is always online, but 97% of US Gen Z still shop in-store,” Rees said. “Wedding dresses, in particular, and the tradition of trying them on, is a rite of passage that Gen Z still want to partake in. So brands will need to create compelling in-store experiences that encourage socializing.” As the oldest GenZers reach marrying age in their mid-20s, they’re increasingly putting their own spin on nuptials and areletting go of some antiquated traditions. Part of this is also being driven by these younger non-conforming consumers being forced into even more cost sensitivity than Millennials. “The cost-of-living crisis has affected Gen Z, and they feel deeply insecure about their finances,” said Rees. “Over half are living paycheck to paycheck and a third are living with their parents. So it’s no surprise that fast fashion, which has seen its market share increase over the last few years due to the cost-of-living crisis, is capitalizing on the need for affordable, on-trend wedding fashion.” Related articleBrides are pumped to wear black wedding dresses At the same time, wedding fashion is a lot less traditional now, she said. With wedding dresses in particular, one trend that emerged during the pandemic was the popularity ofblack wedding gowns. “Gen Z is very much picking up where Millennials left off here. So it’s not uncommon for brides to wear alternative colors to white, or to change outfits several times during the course of the event. So this an area where fast fashion brands can really fill a void,” Rees said. Shein, which launched in 2012 and has since ballooned into theworld’s biggest online-only fast-fashion seller, also sells bridal and wedding wear. Its bridal gowns cost on average between $50 and $100, up to a maximum of $200. On Memorial Day weekend, the retailer will open a wedding-related pop-up shop in Las Vegas to showcase its new bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses. “Affordable prices are important for Gen Z customers, who often balance the desire for fashionable and trendy styles with a need for options that won’t break the bank,” Lisa Zlotnick, spokesperson for Shein, said in an interview with CNN. “As wedding attire evolves from traditional, occasion-specific outfits to versatile, stylish pieces that can be worn on multiple occasions, we aim to ensure our offerings meet this increasing demand.” Even Boot Barn, which sells cowboy boots and westernwear, has jumped on the wedding bandwagon for the first time, with its new western-themed wedding collection of bridal dresses, cowboy boots, hats and accessories priced mostly at $400 and below. “There’s been a surge in country weddings and casual garden weddings coming out of the pandemic as people wanted to get married outdoors. These are also budget-friendly choices,” said Isha Nicole, senior vice president of marketing with Boot Barn, inan interview. “Couples are trying to move away from something that is formal and stuffy to weddings that embrace a different setting. We looked at these trends and it seemed like a right time to support our customer,” Nicole said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/12/business/fast-fashion-wedding-dresses/index.html,CNN,"From the boardwalk to the altar: T-shirt, shorts, bikinis and boot sellers are now dressing brides"
business,"If you took an American Airlines flight in the 1960s, you’d be wined and dined from the Coach-class“Royal Coachman” menu. Your meal began with the beef consommé and proceeded to sautéed breast of chicken in wine. Care for a fruit tartlet for dessert? Today, if you’re flying coach, you’ll need to book a long-distance international flight or – maybe if you’re lucky – a coast-to-coast domestic one to receive a free meal. On shorter flights, you might get a choice of complementary Biscoff cookies or pretzels. Airplane food has fallen a long way from the glory days of in-flight dining when meals were served on white tableclothsand stewardesses scrambled eggs in the air. Disappearing meals have joined a long list of pain points, inconveniences and cutbacks that fliers endure today. But industry cost-cutting isn’t the only reason your tartlet is gone. The end of in-flight dining for many passengers surprisingly rose out of big changes in government regulation, airplane design, in-flight movies, industry tax breaks, plus heightened health and safety concerns. Airline safety protocols and regulations since September 11 have changed what types of cooking knives crews can work with in the air.Airplane galleys are smaller to allow for more passenger seats on a plane. And airlines don’t serve some foods, like peanuts, to protect people with allergies. Meals are often smaller, blander or non-existent. “Meal service was once a point of pride,” said Henry Harteveldt, who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group. Now, “the quality is so poor you have to wonder: Do airline executives actually have taste buds?” Airlines have long looked for ways to cut food production costs and reduce meal preparation times for flight attendants on board. In one famous example during the 1980s, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, bragged about how removing justone olive from every saladsaved the airline $40,000 a year. Cost and speed became more important to airlines than how the food tastes ever since. Carriers like Singapore Airlines or Delta mayhave partnerships with Michelin-starred celebrity chefs,but most companies farm out their food to catering services who may prepare it hours ahead. “People are willing to trade food for low fares,” said Blaise Waguespack, a professor of airline marketing at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. “Your ticket gets you the seat. And anything beyond the seat you pay for.” Charging passengers for food on board – even just a few dollars for a sandwich, snack box or cheese plate - is also a way for airlines to save on taxes. Domestic airfares are subject to a 7.5% federal excise tax, but that tax doesn’t apply tobaggage feesand on-board food, both of which are getting more expensive. Food on planes has been around almost a century, ever since 1920s flight attendants handed out chewing gum to passengers to relieve pressure in their ears. Early airplanes bounced so much in flight that meals were served on paper plates, according to theSmithsonian. For decades, the federal government regulated airfare and routes, so airlines tried to set themselves apart with service, food and the kind of luxury usually afforded cruise passengers – or a Bond villain. Until 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the law required that every passenger got an entrée, two vegetables, a salad, dessert and a drink as part of their ticket price, according to the Smithsonian. “Delicious food adds to the enjoyment. It’s prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, where dishes can be cooked in five-minute ovens,” Pan Am advertised in a 1958commercial. During the 1960s and 1970s, airlines routinely installed sky-high kitchens on board and advertised their menus to draw customers. Beef was a business strategy. ”Airlines competed on service and amenities. Meal service was a big focus of [competition] because entertainment options were more limited,” Harteveldt said. “Airlines would have teams of chefs, their own catering kitchens [and] advertising around food.” As deregulation took hold, airlines cut ticket prices. But to make up for lost revenue, they cut back onfood choices and other servicesas well. The September 11 attacks accelerated the decline of free airline meals. Airlines faced a deep reduction in demand and slashed in-flight meal service in response. United, American Airlines, Delta and others announcedsharp reductions in-flight meal serviceshortly after the attacks. The last holdout, Continental Airlines, became the final major airline to end free domestic meals in economy class in 2010. Airline meals had been the brunt of jokes and criticism for decades, but now people miss them. Few airline-industry experts see them coming back anytime soon in coach. The reality is very different for business and first-class passengers. Molly Brandt, the executive chef of culinary innovation for North America at in-flight catering company Gategroup, said that the “golden age for airline food is here.” It just depends on which airline you’re flying and category you’re in. “It’s broken down by cabin class,” she explained. If you’re in first class on an American flight, for example, you may have a lunch choice of a Mediterranean bowl, chicken breast with mojo sauce, Poblano black bean rice and plantains or penne pasta with plant-based ragu and ricotta. For Delta, pick between the cheeseburger, the spinach and cheese agnolotti, or a Hempler’s smoked peppered chicken breast salad. A handful of airlines even offer caviar to first class passengers. But most fliers these days don’t even get the free chewing gum.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/airplane-food-travel/index.html,CNN,A brief history of airline food’s rapid descent
