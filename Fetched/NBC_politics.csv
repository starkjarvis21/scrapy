Politics,"Attorneys for former President Donald Trump sought to pierce   Thursday, casting the adult film actor as someone whose retelling of their alleged sexual encounter was rife with inconsistencies and driven by a desire to harm him. Trump’s lawyer Susan Necheles asked Daniels on the stand in Manhattan criminal court in New York City about making “a lot of money” from her story over the years, striking deals worth a million dollars or more. She also needled Daniels over the different ways she has described the encounter in magazine and prime-time interviews, as well as in the courtroom. Daniels pushed back, saying that while she made a living speaking out against Trump, “I was not selling myself to anyone.” Daniels’ story is   of the prosecution's hush money case against Trump. The bid to silence her in the waning days of the 2016 presidential race came as Trump’s campaign feared he could not withstand further damage after a recording of him talking about inappropriately “grabbing” women threatened to derail his candidacy. Trump has been charged with 34 state counts related to falsifying business records, which prosecutors say were used to obscure the payments to Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He has also denied having had an affair with Daniels. Here's what you missed on Day 14 of the criminal trial. Necheles pressed Daniels about varying details in her retelling of the 2006 encounter with Trump, such as her saying she felt light-headed, which Daniels did not include in media interviews. On Thursday, Necheles, the Trump attorney, asked Daniels more than two dozen times about her account, casting it as a fabrication used to extort money at a sensitive time for Trump. Necheles said that Daniels “wanted to make money” from the attention and that she had even made it the “centerpiece” of her 2018 book. “You were threatening that you would try to hurt President Trump politically by telling this story if he didn’t give you money, right?” Necheles asked. She also pointed to merchandise Daniels marketed online, including a $40 “Stormy Saint of Indictments” candle and a “Stormy Daniels Political Power” comic book. Necheles further noted that Daniels appeared to celebrate Trump’s indictment in the case by tweeting the same day about popping champagne. “That was me doing my job,” Daniels said in response. The defense also suggested that prosecutors had worked to shape Daniels’ testimony before she took the stand for the first time Tuesday. Necheles asked her whether she was supposed to include certain details at their urging and from her book.Trump’s attorneys have sought throughout the trial to portray certain witnesses as selectively highlighting facts to help the Manhattan district attorney’s case. “There’s nothing wrong with detail,” Daniels said Thursday. “My story never changed,” she said later. Another Trump attorney, Todd Blanche, cited Daniels' lurid testimony of the alleged encounter with Trump as he renewed a bid for a mistrial, arguing it was prejudicial when Daniels described “an imbalance of power” between herself and Trump, even as she said she did not feel physically threatened, and when she recalled a “spanking” with a rolled-up magazine. “None of that is information that goes to motive,” Blanche said. The judge rejected the mistrial motion. He also dismissed a request by the defense to loosen the rules on the gag order against Trump. Two new witnesses who worked for Trump took the stand Thursday under subpoena: a Trump Organization employee and Trump’s former executive assistant in the White House. Both gave compelling testimony about Trump’s micromanagement of his affairs, such as his signing off on $6,000 annual dues to a golf club, for which he wrote ""PAY ASAP OK"" on the invoice. Madeleine Westerhout, the former White House assistant, described Trump's habits, including how he liked to keep his Oval Office desk pristine for meetings and used the dining room as his “working office.” There, he would be “working, reading, going over documents,” she said, noting that while he kept things organized, he did have a lot of papers. “I found that he always knew where things were,” Westerhout said. She said he “liked hard-copy documents” and, to her knowledge, did not have an email address. Westerhout left the White House after she spoke disparagingly about Trump’s family at a meeting with reporters that she believed was off the record; her comments were reported publicly. In contrast to Daniels, Westerhout spoke warmly of Trump, painting a picture of a family man who cared deeply about his wife, Melania Trump. Rebecca Manochio, the Trump Organization employee who took the stand Thursday, testified about how checks were handled both before and during Trump's time in office. She described putting together checks with their invoices for Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg to sign, which he continued to do after Trump took office. Certain checks required Trump’s signature, Manochio said, and she recalled at least one occasion when she sent just one. Trump took notes and gazed ahead as Manochio told the court that roughly once a week she would send checks by FedEx for Trump to sign at the White House. She then mailed the checks that Westerhout would handle at the White House. A third new witness for the day — Tracey Menzies, an executive at HarperCollins — testified to the accuracy of certain excerpts from a book by Trump that her company published, “Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and in Life.” An excerpt that was introduced into the court record focused on Trump’s urging to “value loyalty above everything” at the Trump Organization and on how he claimed to “go out of my way” to make life “miserable” for a woman he said “was very disloyal.” Westerhout described Trump’s process for using Twitter, now X, when he was in the White House. She said that besides Trump, only deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino had access to the president's account in 2017 and that Trump had a distinct style. “There were certain words that he liked to capitalize … and he liked to use exclamation points,” Westerhout said. “It’s my understanding that he liked to use the Oxford comma.” She also recalled how Michael Cohen met with Trump at the White House but did not specifically remember seeing him there. The meeting is a key event in the prosecution's narrative of an election interference plot. Westerhout described Trump as detail-oriented and said he preferred to sign documents himself using a Sharpie or a Pentel felt-tip pen. She recounted that Trump would sign every check by hand in his office and return them to her in a folder. Trump signed a lot of material, Westerhout said while being questioned by Necheles. She also talked about a text message she sent to Hope Hicks, a top aide to Trump, asking, “Hey — the president wants to know if you called David Pecker again?” Pecker, a former publisher of the National Enquirer, previously testified about his role in a scheme to “catch and kill” stories potentially damaging to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, including an account by Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who said she had a monthslong relationship with Trump starting about a decade before the election. After the jury left the courtroom Thursday, Trump's attorney Blanche mentioned that the DA's office had informed him that prosecutors will no longer call McDougal to testify.

Politics,"Two Russian online film distributors, including a company owned by Nasdaq-listed internet giant Yandex have been charged with offenses under the country’s so-called LGBT propaganda law, a notice on a Moscow court’s website said. Russia last year   its restrictions on the promotion of what it calls LGBT propaganda amid a broader clampdown on queer rights, which President Vladimir Putin has sought to portray as evidence of moral decay in Western countries. The companies, Kinopoisk and Restream Media, face an administrative case for the “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships” or “gender reassignment” online, according to the notice posted on Wednesday. Separate charges were filed on Wednesday against two Kinopoisk and Restream Media executives for the same offense, an online court notice showed. Yandex-owned Kinopoisk and Restream Media, majority-owned by digital services giant Rostelecom have both been   under a similar article banning the “demonstration” of LGBTQ relationships to minors. That resulted from them listing films such as “Bridget Jones’s Diary” and “Perfect Strangers” without an 18+ label. A spokesperson for Kinopoisk told Reuters that the charge was related to its listing of the U.S. television series “Supergirl,” which features a same-sex relationship, and that the company planned to challenge the court ruling. “The laws and regulations as currently drafted do not provide sufficient objective criteria for determining propaganda of non-traditional relationships,” the company said in a statement provided to Reuters. “We hope that the current practice of fines against online cinemas will be revised to warnings.” Restream Media did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/two-russian-online-film-distributors-charged-lgbt-propaganda-law-rcna151472,NBC,Two Russian online film distributors charged under 'LGBT propaganda' law
Politics,"President Joe Biden is trying to thread the needle on Israel’s war against Hamas, but his   to Benjamin Netanyahu’s government left some in Washington wondering whether he’s lost that thread. “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,” Biden   Wednesday. “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities — that deal with that problem.” In point of fact, Israel is conducting limited military operations in Rafah, the Gaza city where more than 1 million Palestinians have clustered since the war began in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack on the Jewish state. Biden said Israel has not yet crossed a “red line” by going into population centers. But at the same time the Biden administration is delaying an official certification that U.S. weapons aren’t being used to undercut humanitarian efforts to protect civilians, the president is drawing a new rhetorical line in the sand. Some in his own party see that as counterproductive to Biden’s policy and political aims. He would like the war to conclude as soon as possible, with the release of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas, and he would like for pro-Palestinian activists to stop hammering him at home as he seeks re-election. “The problem is this message that they’re sending can’t accomplish both of those things,” said one Democratic lawmaker who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid criticism of Biden’s position. “Because now, if you want Hamas to release the hostages and they see the U.S. pulling back, it relieves the pressure on Hamas.” This lawmaker said that figures to lengthen the war, rather than bringing a conclusion, which in turn threatens to extend Biden’s domestic political quandary. “If the hostages are not going to be released, then the war is going to continue, with or without U.S. missiles,” the lawmaker said. Republicans were quick to condemn Biden’s position. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently worked with the Biden White House to enact an aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan,   that he hopes Biden’s remarks were a “senior moment.” And in an interview with North Carolina’s Spectrum News 1, former President Donald Trump said he “wouldn’t do what Biden did.” “He just abandoned Israel,” Trump said.  But progressives welcomed what they saw as a turn in the right direction.  “Biden has taken the position that 37 Democrats did in voting no on offensive weapons to Gaza that could be used for an invasion in Rafah,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a co-chair of Biden’s campaign. “That now is the mainstream Democratic position, and the recent vote on the offensive weapons to Israel will be seen akin to the Iraq War one.” Last month, Democrats voted 173-37 for a stand-alone measure that provided aid to Israel, including for offensive weapons, before it was wrapped into the larger package of foreign military assistance that Biden signed into law. If Biden is mainstreaming the progressive view, he’s doing so at the potential cost of standing with roughly 20% of his party’s House contingent and against the vast majority of Republican officials inside and outside Congress. The question for Biden as he tries to manage Israel’s war from afar is whether he’ll net more support at home by moving closer to the pro-Palestinian progressives who have given him fits since the start of the war. Adult film star Stormy Daniels returned to the stand in  , pushing back during cross-examination on his defense attorney’s attempts to discredit her in sometimes bizarre and uncomfortable exchanges.  Trump’s attorney Susan Necheles grilled Daniels about the $130,000 nondisclosure agreement she signed with Trump’s then-attorney Michael Cohen near the close of the 2016 election, and tried to poke holes in her now-sworn statements about the sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, which he denies.  Necheles asked her about the number of porn films she’s written and directed, and said, “You have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex.” “Wow. That’s not how I would put it,” Daniels replied. “The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room” with Trump. She added, “If that story was untrue, I would’ve written it to be a lot better.” Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s former White House executive assistant, was called as a witness later in the day. 💲 Will Trump take the stand? He previously said that he “absolutely” would testify, but has since softened those comments.  Two of Trump’s   come with politically fraught complications: the Republican governors who would choose their successors. If Trump goes with   of Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis would be in line to select his replacement — perhaps immediately if Rubio resigns and relocates to avoid the constitutional hang-up of having both candidates on the ticket residing in the same state. If   of Ohio becomes vice president, Gov. Mike DeWine would pick a new senator. Both governors have  ,   with Trump, raising doubts about whether the people they appoint would meet the often rigid right-wing standards of his MAGA movement. And while the succession dynamic will not necessarily sink Rubio’s or Vance’s chances of being selected, it is the subject of speculative conversation in both states. DeSantis and Trump are coming off a bitter clash for the GOP presidential nomination. Though there are signs of détente, enough trust issues remain that the idea of handing DeSantis the power of a Senate appointment is one that Trump world is approaching cautiously. In Ohio, Trump   against DeWine’s endorsed candidate, state Sen. Matt Dolan, in a recent GOP Senate primary, branding DeWine as a crusty establishment avatar and RINO.

Politics,"The   is expected to propose a rule Thursday that would accelerate the pace at which certain migrants could be processed and denied asylum after having crossing the southern border, according to two sources familiar with the decision. The regulation, which had been in the works for months and will be published by the Department of Homeland Security, seeks to cut down on illegal border crossings. It would specifically target people who are deemed ineligible for asylum because of criminal records or who are assessed to be national security risks, one of the sources said.  The asylum process  , and the proposed rule will aim to shorten that time substantially for those deemed ineligible. It is not considered the major executive action NBC News has been previewing  , which could still materialize in the near term. The White House declined to comment. As the Biden administration   on the border that could affect the asylum process, up Pennsylvania Avenue, Senate Democrats had an initial closed-door conversation Wednesday about what legislative steps they could take. “I think the starting point for the discussion is the bipartisan deal that was negotiated, so we’ll start there. Do we subtract a little bit, do we add a little bit? We don’t know yet,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NBC News after the meeting. “Everybody realizes we are going to have a meaningful discussion about it in the coming weeks.” NBC News reported Monday that Democrats in the Senate could force “messaging” votes on immigration and border-related provisions that Republicans would most likely block. Republicans blocked the bipartisan package negotiated by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., in February at the behest of former President Donald Trump.  But asked about the administration’s actions during his leadership news conference Wednesday, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Biden administration and congressional Democrats “agree” that “the best thing to deal with the problem on the border is pass legislation.” “We have strong bipartisan drafted legislation,” Schumer said. “If Republicans are serious about fixing the border, join us — we can only pass it with Republican votes, Democratic votes and Republican votes, and that’s what we should do.” Senators threw out ideas during the closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to multiple Democrats who spoke with NBC News.  Earlier Wednesday, a collection of progressive and Hispanic lawmakers   to streamline pathways to citizenship for long-term, undocumented immigrants and expressed concerns with the administration’s potential plans to restrict some asylum through unilateral action. “As the Biden administration considers executive actions on immigration, we must not return to failed Trump-era policies aimed at banning asylum and moving us backward,” Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said at a news conference. “I urge President Biden to embrace our values as a nation of immigrants and use this opportunity to instead provide relief for the long-term immigrants of this nation.”  last month found that just 28% of voters approve of Biden’s handling of border security and immigration, an issue that   as a top concern for Americans.

Politics,"The Democratic National Committee is making new tech investments to bolster its efforts to reach young voters and voters of color in an increasingly fragmented environment,   laying out the party’s strategies in the months leading up to the general election. Bolstered by the over $192 million they have amassed in the first quarter of this year, Democrats have doled out millions to acquire data and new technology to specifically target voters in battleground states and create a “data infrastructure” that can equally be used by national and state parties.  The party has invested $2 million this cycle in cellphone data to better target voters in battleground states, according to the memo, which touted expanding its cellphone coverage on voter lists from 30% of voters in 2016 to over 80% now. An additional $2 million annually has been invested in “models and commercial data to better understand voters.” The Democrats point to the Wisconsin state Supreme Court race as evidence of the benefit of having such data on file, citing the 1.4 million calls and texts Wisconsin Democrats made to support candidates last year, including Janet Protasiewicz, who was elected to the court. The DNC says that so far, it has made 1.2 million calls and sent 5.4 million texts to engage voters and promote events, recruit for organizing activities and support voter registration efforts in battleground states. It plans to invest more in its relational organizing programs to better reach young voters and voters of color before the election. That includes a Wisconsin-based pilot program that has been engaging with youth voters on college campuses in Green Bay, Madison, Milwaukee and Eau Claire. Ahead of President Joe Biden’s campaign event in Racine, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, attendees were trained in how to use a relational organizing app, REACH, which the campaign described as a program helping “voters connect with people they already know about the importance of the election.” The bet is that friends and peers will be best placed to persuade on-the-fence people in their social networks to back Biden. “Over the last several months, REACH has been used successfully by Team Biden-Harris supporters and volunteers in the Black community as part of a first-of-its-kind relational organizing program in Milwaukee,” Garren Randolph, the campaign manager for the Wisconsin Democratic Coordinated Campaign, wrote in a memo this week. The DNC also touted other investments in its memo. , which Biden comfortably won in 2020, Democrats are also broadening their investments to target traditionally red states. This election cycle, the party has invested more than $4.5 million in its Red State Fund, which allocates resources for programs in traditionally Republican states. Kentucky, where Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won re-election last year, is among the red states that have seen big increases in national party investment. And the DNC also touted new investments in election security measures. It said in its memo it’s making seven-figure investments in a “robust voter protection operation,” including launching an online training system comprised of 57 videos, training voting staff members in topics from election administration and ballot curing to organizing and federal law. In addition, the party said it will continue to support a voter assistance hotline. It said that it received over 28,000 calls in the 2022 midterms and that so far this cycle it has received more than 9,000.

Politics,"A federal jury in New York on Thursday convicted an investor of   in the stock of a shell company ahead of its announcement in October 2021 that it would merge with  . The investor,  , had been on the board of directors of the publicly traded company,  , at the time he was accused of sharing and exploiting non-public information with others about its plans to merge with then-privately held Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app. Trump Media’s majority shareholder is former President  , who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case against Garelick in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But Garelick’s trial, which began on April 30, took place just blocks away from where Trump is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court on criminal charges related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Two co-defendants of Garelick, the brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on April 3. Jurors in Garelick’s case began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and a defense lawyer. After several hours of deliberation Thursday, jurors returned guilty verdicts on the five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy that the 54-year-old Garelick faced. Garelick, who testified at his trial, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 12. Garelick was an investment advisor to Michael Shvartsman’s venture capital firm, Rocket One Capital. Prosecutors said Garelick shared non-public material information about DWAC’s merger plans with Trump Media with the Shvartsman brothers in 2021 after joining DWAC’s board. All three men then bought up DWAC stock based on that non-public information and then sold their shares after the price soared following the announcement of the deal to combine with Trump Media, prosecutors said. Garelick made a profit of just $49,000 on the illicit trades, but the Shvartsmans earned a whopping $23 million, according to prosecutors. “Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement Thursday. “When he was given that opportunity, Garelick promised to keep the information about DWAC’s interest in acquiring Trump Media secret and not use it to trade in the stock market. Garelick was also given a seat on DWAC’s board, which gave him direct access to additional non-public information regarding the acquisition,” Williams said. “As a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,” the top prosecutor said. “Garelick’s federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.” DWAC and Trump Media completed their merger in late March. Public trading of the company’s stock under the new ticker DJT began a day later. Last week, the   charged Trump Media’s auditor with what the regulator said was  nvolving the auditor’s accounting work for hundreds of publicly traded companies, affecting 1,500 SEC filings.

Politics,"Adult film star   returned to the stand in Donald Trump's  Thursday, pushing back during cross-examination against his defense attorney's attempts to discredit her in sometimes bizarre and uncomfortable exchanges. After she was done testifying in Manhattan criminal court in New York, Trump's attorney Todd Blanche moved again for a mistrial, saying she'd changed her story and been allowed to testify about matters that were irrelevant to the case. He also asked the judge to waive Trump's gag order to allow him to respond to her testimony publicly. State Judge Juan Merchan denied both requests. “My concern is not just with protecting Ms. Daniels or a witness who has already testified. My concern is protecting the integrity of the proceedings as a whole,” Merchan said of the gag order request. Trump blasted the judge's actions on Thursday, calling them ""a disgrace"" to reporters in the courthouse afterwards. ""I'm innocent and I'm being held in this court with a corrupt judge,"" he said. Daniels took to social media Thursday night with a not-so-subtle dig at Trump. ""Real men respond to testimony by being sworn in and taking the stand in court. Oh...wait. Nevermind,""  . It's unclear   in his own defense. When Daniels was on the stand, Trump attorney Susan Necheles grilled her about the $130,000 nondisclosure agreement she signed with Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen near the close of the 2016 election and tried to poke holes in her now-sworn statements about the sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, which he denies. Necheles asked her about the number of porn films she has written and directed and said, “You have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex.” “Wow. That’s not how I would put it,"" Daniels replied. ""The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room” with Trump. She added, ""If that story was untrue, I would’ve written it to be a lot better.” Necheles and Daniels sparred over minor inconsistencies in Daniels’ stories, including her having said in a 2011 interview that she and Trump had dinner together while she now maintains they never actually ate. “I had dinner in the room, but we never got any food, and we never ate anything,"" Daniels said. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger noted on re-direct examination that the article with the 2011 interview said the piece had been ""lightly edited."" Necheles also sought to dispute Daniels' claims that she was scared when she saw Trump waiting for her in bed in a T-shirt and boxers after she got out of the bathroom, implying that a porn actor wouldn't be caught off-guard by someone in underwear. Necheles asked whether it was the first time in her life someone had made a pass at her. Daniels said it was the first time with somebody ""twice my age and bigger than me"" who had a bodyguard outside the door. “You wanted money from President Trump, right?” Necheles asked earlier in their exchange. “No,” Daniels answered. “I never asked for money from President Trump,” she said. “I never asked for money from anyone in particular. I asked for money to tell my story” in 2016, and it was Cohen who approached her attorney with the NDA. She said she thought the agreement was “a perfect solution,” giving her a paper trail and peace of mind without having to tell her story publicly. Daniels also acknowledged that she was irate when Cohen appeared to be stalling on paying the money but that he eventually paid. Necheles also asked about a statement she signed in 2018 denying she'd had an affair with Trump after The Wall Street Journal wrote about her NDA. Daniels said her lawyer had given her the statement and told her she had to sign it. She said she decided she wanted to tell her story later that year, after Cohen began talking about her publicly. Asked whether she'd promised people she'd be instrumental in putting Trump in jail, Daniels said, ""No."" Necheles then asked her about a social media post in which someone had called her a human toilet, and Daniels responded, ""Exactly! Making me the best person to flush the orange turd down."" Necheles asked whether that meant she'd be instrumental in getting rid of him. Daniels said it was ""hyperbole.""  ""I'm also not a toilet,"" she said. Daniels spoke more slowly and seemed more confident Thursday than on her first day on the stand, but her voice shook some when Necheles asked her about various mean tweets she has been the target of, including ones referring to her as an ""aging harlot"" and a “disgusting degenerate prostitute.” “When somebody attacks me I’m going to defend myself,” she said, sounding like she was on the verge of tears. After Daniels was done testifying, her lawyer Clark Brewster told NBC News she was ""shaken"" by the ordeal and ""relieved"" to be done. “She was cross-examined over communications over years, and having your memory challenged like that and having to respond to questions immediately with recall is not easy, and it was quite an accomplishment,” Brewster said, adding, “She did a remarkable job of getting her testimony across.” During the discussion about the defense’s renewed request for a mistrial, Merchan said he was surprised Trump's lawyers didn’t object to certain parts of Daniels’ testimony. He cited one part where Daniels said Trump told her: “I thought we were getting somewhere, we were talking, and I thought you were serious about what you wanted. If you ever want to get out of that trailer park.” “I was offended because I never lived in a trailer park,” Daniels said. The judge said he struck that part of her testimony. Trump sat with his eyes closed for parts of Daniels' testimony. He was accompanied to court by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who left in the late morning. On his way out of court, Scott took some jabs at three people whom Trump is prevented from criticizing by the gag order in the case — Judge Juan Merchan's daughter, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's wife and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. Scott didn’t name any of the three, but it was clear from his remarks — including saying ""the judge's daughter is a political operative"" — to whom he was referring. It's unclear whether prosecutors will try to argue the comments violated the gag order. The ruling bars Trump from making ""or directing others to make"" comments about individual prosecutors or relatives of people involved with the case, in addition to remarks about witnesses and jurors. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s former White House executive assistant, testified later in the day that she had seen Trump sign checks in the Oval Office and that he had been “very upset” by Daniels’ claims. Westerhout said she got to know Trump while she was working at the Republican National Committee in 2016. She said there was concern at the RNC in October 2016 after the release of the so-called ""Access Hollywood"" tape, a 2005 recording of Trump saying he can grope women without their consent. Asked whether there were conversations at the RNC about potentially replacing Trump as the Republican nominee at that time, Westerhout said there were. Trump remained the nominee and won the election, and she said she helped the president-elect schedule meetings at Trump Tower, which is what led to her White House job. Her duties included acting as an intermediary between Trump and his company the Trump Organization, coordinating with Rhona Graff, Trump's assistant there, on issues that needed his or the company's attention, like his travel schedule, mail or phone calls.  She said she asked Graff for a list of Trump's contacts, which Graff forwarded to her. The list included information for Cohen and  , the former National Enquirer publisher who testified he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress scandalous stories about Trump, including Daniels' claim. Westerhout said Trump was ""very upset"" when the Daniels story became public. She broke down in tears as she recalled losing her job in August 2019, after she   about Trump's family at a dinner with reporters that she believed to be confidential. She called the incident a mistake and said, ""I've learned a lot from my experience."" She also defended her former boss, saying she believed he has been treated unfairly. She will continue her testimony Friday. After Daniels was done testifying, Blanche told the judge that she'd changed her story by saying she felt there was a power imbalance between them and that she blacked out and was light-headed when they began having sex. He also said there was no reason for prosecutors to have asked her about supposedly spanking him with a magazine before the encounter or for Daniels to have testified that Trump did not use a condom. ""That has nothing to do with the false business record, but it’s so prejudicial. It’s a dog whistle for rape,” Blanche said. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told Merchan: “Those messy details, that is motive. That is Mr. Trump’s motive” for buying her silence. He also suggested that Trump could rebut the story under oath. “If they want to offer testimony that the sex never happened, that’s their prerogative,” he said. He also said there were some ""very salacious details that were intentionally omitted because we did not have the desire to embarrass the defendant.” Merchan said he agreed with Blanche that there shouldn’t have been questions or answers about the condom, but noted that there was no objection from attorneys to that line of questioning at the time. The judge also pointed out that Blanche had said in his opening statement that Trump didn’t have sexual relations with Daniels. “Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe. Donald Trump, who denies that there was an encounter, or Stormy Daniels, who claims that there was,” Merchan said. In addition to the sexual encounter, which Daniels said happened after she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, she told jurors that Trump made a sexual advance in 2007, which she rejected. Four years later, she said, a mysterious man warned her to “ ” after she gave an interview to a magazine about their first encounter. Daniels said the article never ran thanks to Trump's then-“fixer” and lawyer Cohen. Cohen later paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about her claim. Trump's reimbursement of that money to Cohen is at the heart of the criminal case against Trump, who is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to the repayment. He has pleaded not guilty. Daniels was followed on the stand by Rebecca Manochio, a Trump Organization employee who was an assistant to the company's former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. She said that after Trump went to the White House, she would FedEx checks for him to sign and then get them to the proper person at the company when they were returned. Her testimony was used to enter records relating to Trump's checks to Cohen. After Manochio, prosecutors called Tracy Menzies, an executive at HarperCollins Publishers. She was brought in to read into the record from a book Trump co-authored for the company called ""Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life."" One of the 2007 book's chapters was titled ""Do Not Trust Anyone."" ""I just can't stomach disloyalty,"" the book reads, mentioning a woman who had been disloyal. ""I go out of my way to make her life miserable,” the book says. “My motto is 'Always get even. When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.'” The DA's office is nearing its final set of witnesses. Steinglass estimated this week that prosecutors would be done presenting their case by May 21. One person who won’t be testifying is Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model who claims she had a monthslong affair with Trump that began in 2006 and was paid $150,000 to keep quiet in 2016 by the National Enquirer. Trump has denied her claim. Blanche told Merchan that prosecutors informed him she wouldn’t be taking the stand. Adam Reiss is a reporter and producer for NBC and MSNBC.

Politics,"Fifty-six scanning systems that can detect fentanyl in personal vehicles at southern U.S. border crossings will now be installed because of $200 million in new funding that was approved by Congress after   the scanners were sitting unused in warehouses. Ninety-five percent of the fentanyl U.S. law enforcement seizes is discovered in personal vehicles driven across the border by U.S. citizens, according to Department of Homeland Security officials, and the scanners are the strongest tool the Biden administration has to detect fentanyl in vehicles. After the NBC News report,  ,   and two   called for additional funding to install the scanners that had been previously requested by DHS. Funding to finally install the machines came through the House Homeland Security appropriations bill,  . The 56 that will be installed because of the new funding will be in place by 2026, according to a senior Customs and Border Protection official. Thirty-one scanning systems are already in place, and 27 are under construction. All of the scanners were appropriated in 2021. DHS says that once the scanners are in place, 40% of all personal vehicles crossing the border will be scanned. Now, fewer than 5% of personal vehicles are X-rayed, according to DHS officials.  At ports of entry without scanners, customs officers have to rely on their own intuition to detect something amiss and hold vehicles for further inspection. Since 2021, the U.S. government has struggled to install fentanyl scanners at ports of entry. Critics have applauded the progress but say it’s still just a drop in the bucket. Bobby Watt was at CBP for over 30 years and oversaw non-intrusive inspection scanning at ports of entry before he left CBP in 2019; he blames red tape for the delays. He says the goal should be to scan 100% of personal vehicles. “It’d be foolish not to,” said Watt, now an adviser to scanning contractor Viken Detection. “Because if you were a drug smuggler, would you go to a port that had an X-ray? Or would you go to the one next to it that didn’t have an X-ray?”  DHS has pointed to construction challenges with installation, such as a lack of room at ports of entry to install the systems, and says it doesn’t have the funding from Congress needed to scan 100% of vehicles. The senior CBP official said the 40% of vehicles that will be scanned won’t be randomly chosen; instead, they’ll be vehicles determined to pose the highest risk. New congressional funding to reach 40% of the vehicles was hailed by some parents who have lost children to fentanyl, like Cindy DeMaio, who lost her daughter in Ohio to fentanyl poisoning in 2016. DeMaio works with parents around the country to educate others about fentanyl, including putting up billboards along the southern border where fentanyl is being driven across. “Anything we can do to increase the catching of these people and decrease the negative impacts on our country is extremely powerful,” she said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has criticized the slow efforts to install the scanners. In the fall he called for the Government Accountability Office to examine how DHS has spent more than a billion dollars on the X-ray equipment. The inquiry is underway, a GAO spokesperson said, and a report will be completed this year. Cornyn and Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., want any new scanners to be tested to ensure that any technology purchased in the future is the most effective. They introduced a   this year to evaluate five kinds of scanners to ensure they catch the most fentanyl.  “Last year, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl at the southern border to kill every American 16 times over, and we have no way of knowing how much more evaded law enforcement,” Cornyn said. “This legislation would help address glaring problems in the fentanyl detection system by requiring CBP to test new pieces of detection technology at land ports of entry so we can prevent this deadly drug from claiming more lives.” In a statement, a CBP spokesperson said, ""CBP has repeatedly sought funding for the installation of NII [scanner] technology — including the civil works funding needed to install existing systems, which was requested in the supplemental funding request in October 2023 and partially funded by the recent appropriation."" ""Non-intrusive inspection technology is one tool in in CBP’s multi-layered approach to interdicting fentanyl and contraband,"" said the spokesperson.

Politics,"HIALEAH, Fla. — Some Florida groups that support abortion rights are concerned that a ballot measure to and invalidate the recently enacted six-week abortion ban may not pass in November if more donor money is not pumped into these organizations to raise awareness and turn out voters. “This bill passing is not a slam-dunk deal by any means,” said Alex Berrios, co-founder of the progressive group Mi Vecino, which is focused on voter education and mobilization. “While there is overall support for the ballot measure, there is not nearly enough without persuading undecided voters.” Florida   after six weeks of gestation — before many women know they're pregnant —  to adapt  Until the ban went into effect,   in the Southeast where abortion was still largely accessible. Now the closest state with abortion access beyond six weeks is North Carolina, where it is allowed until 12 weeks. The proposed amendment would invalidate the six-week ban by barring restrictions on abortion before fetal viability, considered to be at about the 24th week of pregnancy. It would also include exceptions past that point for “the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” Since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade,  voters have favored expanding abortion rights in all the states that introduced abortion-related ballot measures.  But in Florida, amendments need 60% or more approval to pass — a high threshold that worries activists here.  In swing states like   and  , voters have backed abortion rights at the ballot by less than 57%. Berrios and other activists point out that Florida, a larger state with double the population size, requires more volunteers and resources to educate voters about ballot measures and convince them to turn out to vote.  The state has also tilted right in recent years and is no longer considered a swing state, making it more difficult to convince voters who see this as a partisan and not a health-care issue, some activists say. Andrea Mercado, executive director of Florida Rising, a progressive voting rights group, said she has seen an increase in foundation and donor funds to the state's nonprofit groups after the ballot initiative was approved, but “the budget isn’t fully raised by any stretch of the imagination yet,” she said. “Florida is the third largest state in the nation, so to reach our population and to win 60% of the vote is going to require all hands on deck,” Mercado said. “And it will be expensive to make sure that 60% of voters in November vote yes on Amendment 4.” Mi Vecino, a group based in West Palm Beach with offices in Central Florida, usually focuses on Latino voters, but it has been reaching out to all voter groups in Central Florida, knocking on doors since December.  Berrios, the co-founder, said they would be canvassing in South Florida right now but lack the funds to take on the task. So far, they have knocked on about 77,000 doors to talk about the ballot measure and made a quarter-million phone calls to voters in Central and South Florida. “What we found consistently is that voters are very open to supporting this initiative,” said Berrios. “But there’s a lot of work that has to be done around it. Voters are not necessarily motivated to support it.” Among Florida Democrats they've reached out to, about 20% said they were against the amendment, while 13% were undecided — that's almost a third of Democrats who are not presently saying they support the measure. Among Republicans they spoke with, 28% say they support Amendment 4 while 25% are undecided — that's almost half of Republicans that could potentially support the measure, according to Berrios. This shows that for Amendment 4 to get 60% of the vote, the support has to cut across Democrats, Republicans and independents, he said.     Days after Florida’s six-week abortion ban went into effect, Gina Romero, an organizer with Florida Rising, a progressive voting rights group, began canvassing in Hialeah, a working-class city in Miami Dade County that is 95% Latino. A majority voted for Trump in 2020. Armed with flyers and a hat to shield the punishing sun, Romero knocked on doors and spoke to voters where about half seemed to support the measure and the other half did not. Many people weren’t home and Romero left a flyer at their door with information. “We are Catholic. We don’t believe in abortion,” said Maria Luisa Benitez, a retired agricultural engineer, as she discussed Amendment 4 with Romero at her doorstep, her dogs barking in the background. Benitez did agree there should be certain exceptions to abortion restrictions when a woman's health is endangered.  Down the block, Doris Saldá, 68, said she supports Amendment 4 and called the abortion ban “an attack on my body.” “I pay taxes and I’m law abiding. I should have the freedom to do what I want with my body,” said Saldá.Nationally, Democrats are seizing on abortion, hoping it will galvanize moderate voters, especially women, to turn out in November.  The Biden campaign often cites Democratic victories in the 2022 midterm election as examples of the issue driving voters to turn out. After Florida’s Supreme Court approved the state's six-week abortion ban, President  Joe Biden made a  , where he blamed Donald Trump for ""this nightmare"" — Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three conservative Supreme Court justices who ruled in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade.  Biden read off a list of states where voters have supported abortion rights measures and said, “This November, you can add Florida to that list.” On the day the six-week ban went into effect, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a  , calling the measure “another Trump abortion ban.” But now that the pivotal swing state has moved further to the right in recent years, some abortion rights advocates stress the importance of seeing abortion access as a health care issue and not a Democratic issue to ensure support across all voters.    Lauren Brenzel, the campaign director of ""Yes on 4,"" which advocates for the amendment, said Floridians are used to the 60% threshold and noted that other ballot measures, like the one on the 2020 ballot to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, passed with 60% of the vote. “Floridians understand that policy can exist outside of the candidate space,” Brenzel said. “That is so important for abortion, because, unfortunately, what we see is political actors on both sides who have really taken this issue and made it a political one, when normal people think this is a health care issue.”   Berrios said that in a state like Florida, ""it’s going to come down to who delivers the most effective message, and then turns out their support. ...

Politics,"Former President   said in an interview Thursday that he “wouldn’t do what Biden did” with regard to Israel policy as he responded to President Joe Biden's comments Wednesday about pausing weapons shipments to Israel if its military invaded Rafah. Trump also invoked a dual loyalty trope and redoubled recent comments criticizing Jewish Democrats in an interview with  , saying that ""if you're a Jewish person, just don't vote for Biden"" because ""you're really hurting your country. He is totally gone on the other side now. He’s gone — he’s dropped Israel."" ""If you’re Jewish, and you vote for him, I say shame on you,"" Trump continued. Trump has made   in recent months, drawing backlash, including   that Jewish Democrats ""should be spoken to.""  , he said Jewish Democrats were ""very disloyal to Israel."" Trump spoke after Biden said in an interview with CNN   to Israel if its forces invade Rafah. ""Well, I wouldn’t do what Biden did. He just abandoned Israel. I’ve never seen anything like it,"" Trump said in the interview Thursday when he was asked whether he would tell Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu there is a limit to Israel's war efforts.  Asked directly whether he was OK with Israel’s invading Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where over 1 million Palestinians are sheltering, Trump responded: “They have to get the job done. Look, they were viciously attacked on October 7. They had scenes that nobody’s ever seen.”  Trump has maintained similar aggressive messaging about Israel’s military efforts, routinely saying at campaign rallies that Israel has to “finish the job.” He has also claimed that the Israel-Hamas war would have never happened if he were still in the White House because of his relationships with foreign leaders.   “Well, I said they should get the job over with fast, fast, they’ll have to make their own solution, but they have to get this job over with fast and get it done because the world is blowing up around them.

A three-judge panel of the court did not consider the merits of his appeal, ruling that as a matter of procedure the lower court’s rejection of his various motions to dismiss are not appealable at this time. “This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court’s orders are appealable before final judgment,” . Lawyers for Biden can seek review from the full bench of the 3rd Circuit or petition the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case.  Reached for comment, Abbe Lowell, lawyer for Biden, said, “In reviewing the panel’s decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate.” U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who is overseeing the case, denied another defense motion to dismiss the indictment on Second Amendment grounds in a separate order Thursday. Biden’s lawyers filed the motion in December, arguing that the case should be dismissed because one of the charges — possession of a firearm by a controlled substance addict — is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment, citing a  that held that gun restrictions must be rooted in “history and tradition.” In denying Biden’s arguments, Noreika on Thursday cited an 8th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that upheld the constitutionality of the statute that was used to charge Biden by comparing it to historical laws keeping firearms out of the hands of people suffering from mental illness.  In a   Thursday, Noreika also confirmed a trial date of June 3 in the gun case and outlined the remaining pretrial deadlines.
