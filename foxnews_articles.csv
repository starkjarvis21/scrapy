https://www.foxnews.com//politics/rita-hart-backs-down-iowa-election-challenge-miller-meeks,politics,Dem Rita Hart backs down in Iowa election challenge to Miller-Meeks amid mounting GOP pressure,"Democrat Rita Hart has formally dropped her election challenge in   to GOP Rep.  , just as Republicans turned up their public relations campaign against the potential election ""steal."" Hart officially lost Iowa's Second Congressional District race in November to Miller-Meeks by just six votes. However, she had filed a formal election contest with the House of Representatives asking for a recount that included 22 ballots that were left out of the final tally, claiming she would have prevailed. But amid a growing GOP-led campaign to quash the challenge and to pressure House Democrats to accept the election results, Hart formally announced Wednesday she will no longer try to overturn the election.  ""After many conversations with people I trust about the future of this contest, I have made the decision to withdraw my contest before the House Committee on Administration,"" Hart said in a statement Wednesday. ""Since Election Day, and throughout this entire process, my mission has been about ensuring the voices of Iowans who followed the law are not silenced. I am saddened that some Iowans’ votes will not count through no fault of their own. The work of ensuring it does not happen again will continue beyond this campaign."" Hart's announcement came the same day that GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy visited Iowa with Miller-Meeks demanding an end to the election contest, claiming the Democratic-led House was trying to steal away the election from Iowa voters. McCarthy argued that Democrats were only considering the challenge to pad out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's very slim majority in the House. ""It's the people's house, not Pelosi's House,"" McCarthy said.  Hart acknowledged the highly charged political climate in her statement. ""Despite our best efforts to have every vote counted, the reality is that the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years has effectively silenced the voices of Iowans,"" Hart said. ""It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility."" Hart thanked her supporters and wished Miller-Meeks the best as she represents the district that was home to the tightest congressional race in the nation.  Miller-Meeks, a veteran, former state lawmaker and a physician, was sworn in with the rest of the Congress on Jan. 3, but her tenure in Congress was conditional on the outcome of the ongoing election contest.  In a video released via Tweet, Miller-Meeks said she was ""deeply appreciative that we're ending this now,"" and wished ""only the best"" for Hart and her family. Miller-Meeks had defended her six-vote win and said the six Democrats on the House Administration Committee reviewing Hart's contest shouldn't have the power to overturn Iowa's result.  ""People should be outraged,"" Miller-Meeks said earlier Wednesday at an event with McCarthy. ""... If six votes aren't enough to win an election then why are six members on a committee able to overturn an election?"" The House Administration Committee that was formally considering the Hart election challenge announced Wednesday the case was officially over since Hart is no longer contesting the outcome.  ""There being no contestant, there is no longer a contest, and the Committee will, accordingly, recommend that the whole House dispose of the contest and adopt a dismissal resolution reported out by the Committee,"" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the committee.  There is still one other ongoing House election contest from 2020. The Republican who lost to Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., in   14th Congressional District similarly appealed the loss to the House Administration Committee before going to court.  Republican candidate Jim Oberweis lost to Underwood by more than 5,000 votes. Illinois election officials certified Underwood as the winner. While Republicans have launched a coordinated campaign against Hart's election challenge as somehow being nefarious, they've raised little concern about Oberweis's contest.  Pressed about the discrepancy Wednesday, McCarthy said it was time for Oberweis to move on. ""I believe Congresswoman Underwood won that race,"" McCarthy told Fox News. ""It was counted through the states, and she has been seated, and I don't support the challenge of that race."""

Biden appeared alongside California Gov. Gavin Newsom in Delano, California and spoke to farmworkers on the birthday of César Chávez, who was considered a transformational labor leader and Latin American civil rights activist. But it was the First Lady’s pronunciation of ""¡Si Se Puede!,"" which translates to ""yes we can"" in Spanish that drew criticism on Twitter.  The   also pointed to the gaffe. The phrase became popularized by Chávez and his United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta, and was used as a motto by the group in the  . It has also been adopted by other activist groups. Biden pronounced it correctly on separate occasions in the same speech, in which she also encouraged farm workers to get vaccinated. The First Lady said that Chávez is a big inspiration to the president, and noted that President Biden began his career ""inspired by the civil rights movement."" ""As president, Joe is fighting for those who often go unseen,"" Jill Biden said. ""He believes that our work must be guided by justice and humanity."""

Al Cutrona, a   who represents parts of eastern Ohio, told Fox News that vaccine passports mandated by the government would create ""privacy concerns that should be startling to anyone."" ""I want to make sure that we put a stop on this from the government,"" Rep. Cutrona -- who runs an infectious disease medical practice in Ohio -- said Wednesday. ""It's a false sense of security, a false sense of normalcy, and frankly, I think it's a very slippery slope that we're heading down."" Rep. Mike Loychik, a Republican cosponsor of Cutrona's bill, tweeted that the ""last thing we should do is follow Andrew Cuomo and New York’s example by implementing vaccine passports.""  became the first state to roll out a digital vaccine passport when it launched ""Excelsior Pass"" last week.  ""As more New Yorkers get vaccinated each day and as key public health metrics continue to regularly reach their lowest rates in months, the first-in-the-nation Excelsior Pass heralds the next step in our thoughtful, science-based reopening,""   of the vaccine passport rollout.  Several private businesses and organizations have started developing ways to confirm that someone is vaccinated, but a growing coalition of conservatives,  , and other activists have expressed concern that government-sponsored vaccine passports would be an intrusion of privacy.  Justin Amash, a former   Congressman and a Republican turned Libertarian, said he believes vaccine passports ""will have exceedingly negative consequences for society."" ""A vaccine passport — a unified, centralized system for providing or denying access to everyday activities like shopping and dining — would be a nightmare for civil liberties and privacy, and it would exacerbate existing social disparities connected to wealth, privilege, and race,"" Amash tweeted.  Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said he fears that a vaccine passport would be overused.  ""While there are legitimate circumstances in which people can be asked for proof of vaccination, we don’t want to turn into a checkpoint society that outlasts the danger of COVID and that casually excludes people without credentials from facilities where vaccine mandates are not highly justified,"" Stanley wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.  Several Republican lawmakers have spoken out against the passport idea in recent weeks.   said Monday that he would pass an emergency order to ban vaccine passports and encouraged the state legislature to make the ban permanent.  ""This is something that has huge privacy implications. It is not necessary to do,""  DeSantis said at a news conference Monday. ""We are not going to have you provide proof of this just to be able to live your life normally.""  that the Biden administration is working on developing vaccine passports, but White House senior adviser Andy Slavitt said Monday the federal government would not be mandating anything.  ""Unlike other parts of the world, the government here is not viewing its role as the place to create a passport, nor a place to hold the data of, of citizens,"" he said during a COVID-19 briefing at the White House. ""We view this as something that the private sector is doing and will do."" More than 150 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in America as of Wednesday evening, according to the CDC. "

""The plan aims to modernize bridges, highways, and roads, remove lead piping and upgrade our sewer system. It throws billions into public transit programs and Amtrak and puts electric charging stations across America."" However, she added, lurking behind the standard infrastructure-related expenditures are climate-centric economic policies and other proposals that will be detrimental to Middle America. ""No one should expect that if this bill gets passed that their commute will get shorter or their airport will run more efficiently or that their gas prices will go lower,"" she said. ""Just like the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill that had little to do with actual COVID relief, only a fraction of this infrastructure bill deals with actual infrastructure and transportation."" As proof, Campos-Duffy cited $400 billion earmarked for Medicaid, $20 billion for reparations for communities that have been divided by the growth of the highway system and $10 billion for a Civilian Climate Corps. Critics have for years decried the work of urban planners like New York's Robert Moses, whose mid-20th-Century projects like Interstate 95's Cross Bronx Expressway and the ultimately-truncated Arthur Sheridan Expressway sliced through several borough neighborhoods. In a   the White House described the Civilian Climate Corps Initiative as putting ""a new generation of Americans to work conserving and restoring public lands and waters, increasing reforestation, increasing carbon sequestration in the agricultural sector, protecting biodiversity, improving access to recreation, and addressing the changing climate."" On ""Fox News Primetime"", Campos-Duffy added that Biden's infrastructure package is ""just the tip of his spending spree: a down payment on the Green New Deal."" ""Businesses will be taxed more, too. If he [Biden] gets his way, America's corporate tax rate will be higher than Communist China,"" she warned. ""His plan could drive businesses overseas and they will take their jobs with them, even if he tries to penalize them for doing so."""

While working on the house with his brother, the new owner recently discovered a letter hidden behind a baseboard. When they examined the find, they discovered that the letter dated back to 1886. It reportedly had been written by a man named Charles Warren and was addressed to Medad Spencer, the man from who Erhorn’s ancestor bought the house from. Erhorn told Fox 17 that the letter was apparently an attempt to get Spencer to buy Warren’s property. He said, ""Charles V. Warren of Hart wanted Medad to sell his property down here, and buy the property up in Hart, his 160 acres."" He continued, ""And it talks about, you know, the good tillage, the streams that run through it, and then the good timber… there's good rail timber, good buildable timber, plenty of wood… small brooks running with trout.""

The organizers of SacAnime responded on Twitter. ""We are aware of the concerns regarding the placer county fairgrounds vaccinations clinic closing during our event,"" the group wrote. ""The clinic never had plans to be open during the scheduled time, and declined our offer to restrict our event space so they could remain open.""

Results stemmed from the multi-case control study   and validated questionnaires sent to nearly 8,000 adults, half of whom had diagnoses for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer, and the other half serving as the control group, without cancer diagnoses. The questionnaire assessed how often participants consumed ultra-processed foods and drinks over a one-year period. The team then used the Nova classification system, which divides foods into four categories, from unprocessed foods to processed ingredients, and beyond to processed foods and ultra-processed foods and drinks. Examples of ultra-processed products would include ""sugary soft drinks, ready meals and mass-produced industrial baked goods,"" a related   from ISGlobal notes.

Cuomo went on to tell viewers that he'll ""be honest"" about the symptoms he feels from the COVID vaccine. His viewers should remain skeptical after he faked his reemergence from his basement from his COVID recovery after he was caught outside at another property with the disease and got into a heated confrontation with a bicyclist who called him out.  Meanwhile, the CNN star has yet to directly address the special treatment he received from his brother, embattled New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, after it was reported that the Democrat prioritized COVID testing to members of his family in the early months of the pandemic while ordinary New Yorkers struggled.  While the scandal has now been incorporated in the ongoing impeachment probe into the governor, CNN appeared to shrug off the controversy.  ""We generally do not get involved in the medical decisions of our employees.

But when the circuit heads to Bristol, Tennessee, this weekend for the   (Sunday, 3:30 p.m., FOX), the sport’s ultimate circuit will have its first dirt race since 1970. And you can get in on all the excitement  . All you have to do is   Best of all, it’s free!  . Here are the six questions to answer in Sunday's contest, along with some thoughts on how the race may go: Which of these drivers will have the best finishing position in Stage 2?The choices:  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  Larson is the betting favorite and there’s a good reason for that: He has four straight top-7 finishes, including a win. Plus, he’s one who has enjoyed some success on dirt tracks. Bell is another one who has enjoyed success at the lower levels on dirt. However, this is such a new race for many in the field that it is tough to picture how things may shake out. Which manufacturer will win Stage 2?The choices: Chevy, Toyota and Ford Larson and his Chevy team have three stage wins now – tying with Denny Hamlin’s Toyota squad for the most. Bell’s Toyota team has yet to win a Stage. Which racing team will have more cars finish in the Top 5 of Stage 2?The choices: Hendrick, Chip Ganassi, Joe Gibbs, Team Penske, Stewart-Haas Racing or None in Top 5 Joe Gibbs Racing leads the team owner standings with Hendrick right behind them. However, Larson and Hendrick could be the favorite in this race because of his strong recent performances and – once again, his history on dirt tracks. How many cautions will there be by the end of Stage 2 (minimum of two cautions at the end of each stage)?The choices: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7+ Bristol is normally not a track that you would expect a lot of wrecks on, but the dirt end of it could lead to less traction for tires and the greater possibility of some wacky stuff taking place. It’s probably a good number to pick around four or five of them to be the final total. Will the same driver win Stage 1 and Stage 2?The choices: Yes or no Larson did that last week, becoming the second driver this season to pull the trick and the first since Hamlin did it during the Daytona 500 in mid-February. It is so difficult to imagine what the track is going to look like and the strategy involved that you are better off taking no just like you would in a Gonzaga vs. the field debate in the NCAA Tournament. How many cars will end up finishing Stage 2? The choices: All 39, 38-37, 36-35, 34-33, 32 or less This is always a tricky question. The gut answer, based on absolutely nothing, is that a few cars don’t survive to the end of Stage 2 for technical issues that may end up cropping up on the dirt surface. Let’s say 36-35 because it seems to just feel right.  for free and you could win $25,000! "

https://www.foxnews.com//auto/joey-logano-nascar-cup-series-bristol-dirt-race,lifestyle,Joey Logano wins NASCAR Cup Series Bristol dirt race,"Somewhere under the thick red haze floating over Bristol Motor Speedway, Joey Logano took the checkered flag for NASCAR's first   in 50 years. He couldn't see much — visibility was next to nothing during this Monday dust storm — but Logano clung to the familiar bottom lane around the bullring to collect the checkered flag on this   experiment. Logano got a jump on Denny Hamlin on the overtime restart to earn his third career victory at Bristol. But this was not the Bristol of old, the track had been covered with 2,300 truckloads of red Tennessee clay so that NASCAR could add a dirt track to the Cup schedule for the first time since 1970. ""How about Bristol on dirt, guys! This is incredible,"" Logano said to the crowd, a reduced capacity sellout of about 30,000 fans. ""There's nothing like winning at Bristol, but putting it on dirt and being the first to do it is very special."" Logano became the seventh race winner through seven races this season and gave Team Penske back-to-back victories. Ryan Blaney won in a Penske Ford last week. The Logano victory closed a weekend of uncertainty and even some hysteria as NASCAR launched this drive through the dirt. It was broadcast partner Fox who wanted a dirt race on the Cup schedule and Speedway Motorsports, seeking some new energy at its beloved Bristol bullring, said it would take the race. So NASCAR awarded the experiment to Bristol, bypassing dozens of quality established dirt tracks across the country. The snub extended to Tony Stewart, who had successfully hosted seven Truck Series races at his Eldora Speedway dirt track in Ohio but said was never considered for a Cup race. Marcus Smith, the CEO of Speedway Motorsports, insisted concrete Bristol was up to the challenge and he told The Associated Press he'd spent nearly $2 million to make the dirt dream a reality. Smith was pleased with the buzz generated by the event, even as NASCAR huddled for solutions to extreme dust, poor tire durability and shifting weather conditions that made the buildup a muddy mess. When race day finally arrived, torrential overnight rains had flooded the Bristol grounds and NASCAR had to postpone Sunday's show by a day. Through all the consternation, Smith remained optimistic and headed to the track Monday morning convinced this dirt project was a success. The final product was a doubleheader — Martin Truex Jr. won his first Truck Series race in 15 years to open the day — and then Logano closed the Cup race with the overtime victory. Everyone seemed happy, and before the race was even over, the track announced over the public address system that Bristol would run on dirt again next season. ""It’s only my fourth dirt race ever, so I had a lot of fun trying to figure it out,"" Logano said. ""I was having a blast racing, trying to find the right lanes, moving around."" Ricky Stenhouse Jr., a veteran dirt racer, was second for his highest finish of the season. Hamlin, who had last raced on dirt in go-karts when he was 8, finished third. Daniel Suarez was a season-best fourth for new team Trackhouse Racing, which is part-owned by Pitbull. Suarez's first drive on dirt came in Friday practice and he caught on so quickly that he led his first laps of the season — 58 of them in all — and even bumped Logano out of his way to take over the point. But Logano took over with 61 laps remaining and wasn't challenged until the final restart when the race went to a two-lap overtime. It was impossible to handicap this first dirt race because the teams had no idea how to prepare and the drivers had wildly varying experience.   and  , two of the top dirt racers in the country, were the favorites and the race might have gone differently had the two not crashed with each other 54 laps into the race. Seven of the Cup regulars entered the Truck Series race just to get some track time on an unknown surface, a decision that bought them two additional practice sessions as well as Monday's earlier race. Truex, a dirt novice, dominated the field to win the trucks and led a race-high 126 of the 253 laps. Suarez was the other benefactor of adding the truck to his schedule with a breakthrough finish for his brand new team. Of the so-called dirt experts, it was Stenhouse with a quiet runner-up finish who delivered. Ryan Newman, who in the past few years began racing a bit on dirt with some regularity, finished a season-high fifth. There had been serious pre-race concern that the 3,400-pound Cup cars were too heavy for the Goodyear tires on the dirt surface. The combination on Friday, in addition to kicking up serious dirt, caused the tires to wear to the cords while deep ruts developed on the track. The rain that washed out Sunday racing also washed away much of the problems, and an all-nighter by the Bristol track prep crew had the surface ready to go for the doubleheader. It wasn't perfect and the dust was an absolute visibility hazard for the drivers, so much so that midway through the race NASCAR ordered all restarts would be single-file to mitigate the sudden burst of airborne dirt. ""You can’t see. That’s honestly the biggest problem,"" Aric Almirola said after he was hit by multiple cars in an early wreck. ""In dirt racing you don’t have a windshield in front of you, so you can pull a tearoff. We can’t reach out there and pull a tearoff off our windshield, so you can’t see anything. Everybody just comes piling in because you can’t see."""

""I’m starting to call a lot of these products fast groceries, like fast foods from restaurants,"" said Moss. ""And one of the defining characteristics is that they’re so highly engineered and processed, you really can’t tell what original food stuff from the farm went into them."" ""Much of the grocery store now is populated by these products. It’s not just cookies, sodas and ice cream treats, we’re talking the freezer aisle and the pasta sauce aisle and on and on and on."" Moss claimed that those involved in the production of heavily-processed foods seen at chain restaurants and certain grocery aisles don't actually eat what they produce. He argued they either understand the health risks associated with these foods, or are concerned about ""losing control"" to the proclivity to become addicted to sugar and sodium. He went on to say, ""We’re designed to be drawn toward food, addicted if you will, because it’s the last thing we wanted to do was not eat. And so our entire sort of system, so when you look at the comparison to food to drugs, it’s not so much that heroin is the same as or more addictive than sugar. It’s using kind of the same channels to get us hooked on drugs and alcohol."" Moss drew a connection between emotions and food, and noted that companies often use this connection in their marketing. ""Combining food and emotion is something that the companies are really effective on, in terms of their formulation and marketing of the products,"" he said. It was not all doom and gloom, though. Moss acknowledged that adopting healthy eating habits is possible. ""Our habits that we form, even for eating good food, we can change, we can create good eating habits through repetition.""  Change though, moss noted, may take time. ""You know, we have had decades..of bad eating habits imposed, thrown at us by the food industry. It's not easy to switch around."" "

The 47-year-old breakout star quickly became notorious for her flamboyant fashions and her friendship faux pas — both equally loud — on Season 1 of the latest entry in the ""Real Housewives"" franchise. However, the $3.9 million Salt Lake City rental she grandly passed off as the ""SHAH SKI CHALET"" actually never belonged to Shah, The Post has learned.  Instead the 9,420-square-foot home featured on the show is owned by the Texas-based real-estate rental company, Univesco Inc., which is under the limited liability company RJW Capital Investors.  Yes, it was (GASP!) a rental: Property records discovered by The Post reveal Univesco Inc. has owned the home since 2014. And as any true fan knows, in the ""Real Housewives"" universe, few things are more shameful than renting your own home. After all,  once   those who choose to rent. ""I don’t understand the concept of renting at all,"" the ""Real Housewives"" executive producer, 52,   in 2019. ""It’s just throwing money away. Especially a huge home. I don’t get it."" Steven Frey of Univesco told The Post she had no idea that Shah had been hyping the property as her own on the show. A separate spokesperson handling their Utah properties exclusively is expected to provide more details at a later time. Bravo itself may have also been deceived, considering they did not shy away from promoting the chalet on the show, including a  (Reps for the network declined to comment to The Post, but insiders told The Post they were well aware of the rental status.) ""On the November 11 series premiere … Jen Shah hosted a lavish fete at her house, but even before she transformed the abode (which she calls the ""Shah Ski Chalet"") for her castmate Meredith Marks’ birthday, our jaws dropped over her insanely gorgeous home,"" the article gushed. Although it went largely unnoticed at the time, speculation that one of the housewives from the show was renting a property to film   and podcasts. But there was even gossip in the housewives’ inner circle: On a Feb. 12, 2020 episode of  hosted by ""Real Housewives of Dallas"" star Brandi Redmond and Stephanie Hollman, Redmond revealed that she knew someone from the ""RHOSLC"" was renting. ""I do know that one of those ladies is renting a house,"" ginger-maned Redmond teased ominously. ""I don’t know [who it is] because I don’t know the cast but I do know that one of them is a renter because they’re renting some friends of mine’s home."" Shah reacted in her signature over-the-top style to Redmond’s comments on Instagram — after a helpful fan page shared an audio clip of her comments. ""Is this what everyone is getting their g-string up their a** about bcuz [sic] their irrelevant? Or is it bcuz they wish they could afford to pay the rent plus own 4 other homes and have an apt in NYC?"" Shah wrote in the comment section of a now-deleted Instagram post at the time. In a later post she continued to wax poetic: ""You want to come for me with your red hair and bulls–t, come harder honey. You’re about to get a taste of SHAH SQUAD and I don’t mess around. PERIODT."" Note: The Post could find no documentation to substantiate Shah’s claims of owning four other properties and an apartment in NYC. However, the sprawling chalet home featured on Bravo was up for sale in 2019, until the five-bedroom, six-bathroom spread was taken off-market — apparently during the time Shah began filming for the show, according to documents. According to the listing, the timber frame home is equipped with ""three substantial master suites, each with its own fireplace and sitting area, and two additional bedroom suites."" However, off of reality TV, and in actual reality, Shah’s longtime home is located in Sandy, Utah, which she owned with her husband, Sharrieff Shah, from 2004 until she sold it at a loss in June 2020. They initially purchased the home for only $302,069. It sold for $213,000.   Currently, records indicate that Shah and her husband are renting an approximately $8,000/month Park City space — which sorta resembles a mini-me of her TV home — that they moved into shortly after selling their 16-year home.  Shah and her   assistant Stuart Smith, 43, were arrested by the feds on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they face up to 30 years in prison.  ""Shah and Smith flaunted their lavish lifestyle to the public as a symbol of their ‘success,’"" said Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Peter Fitzhugh in a statement. ""In reality, they allegedly built their opulent lifestyle at the expense of vulnerable, often elderly, working-class people."" The indictment out of the Southern District of New York claims Shah and Smith executed a telemarketing scheme with co-conspirators that operated in five states — New York, New Jersey, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. A rep for Shah declined to comment on her arrest. According to the indictment, hundreds of victims, many of whom were over 55, were tricked into investing in shady projects and business services which included coaching sessions, tax preparation and website design services.  What’s worse, many of the individuals targeted did not own a computer.  The alleged scheme took place from 2012 up until as recently as this month.  ""At no point did the defendants intend that the victims would actually earn any of the promised return on their intended investment, nor did the victims actually earn any such returns,"" the indictment states. Her on-set debacle is a far cry from January, when Shah  , announcing she was launching a program dubbed ""Social Commerce,"" to assist women in need amid the  .

https://www.foxnews.com//media/biden-has-a-fast-start-but-is-he-going-too-big-too-fast,politics,"Biden has a fast start, but is he going too big too soon?","While much of the media is hailing Joe Biden as a 21st-century FDR, there are some warning signs on the horizon. ""Go big"" is the unofficial slogan of the new White House, but how big is too big? Meaning, how much major change—and new spending--can the political system swallow before choking? At the moment, the man who the pundits essentially wrote off during the early primaries is off to a reasonably strong start. Whatever you think of his liberal agenda, Biden has delivered on the intertwined issues of the pandemic and the economy, and the polls reflect that. They also reflect that he has botched the growing migrant crisis on the border. But having pushed through $1.9 trillion in economic aid, Biden is just getting started. He plans to press for another $3 trillion in new programs, ranging from infrastructure to climate change. These are staggering numbers: the federal budget for fiscal year 2020 is $4.7 trillion. So Biden is proposing to spend a combined total greater than the country’s annual outlay for everything from Medicare to the military, and of course the feds have been in the red for decades. The administration says the next round will be paid for by raising taxes on the highest earners as well as corporations, which saw their rate slashed from 35 to 21 percent during the Trump years. But some moderate Democrats are already pushing back on the anticipated scope of the tax hikes, which is a problem given the party’s razor-thin margins in both houses. What’s driving this? The   that with nearly 80 percent of the top 50 jobs going to Obama veterans, Biden’s opening act has ""provided the Democratic Party with a rare ‘do-over’ — a chance to enact wide-ranging agenda items far more quickly and on a larger scale than in 2009."" The prevailing wisdom now is that Obama was too timid with his stimulus and wasted too much time negotiating with the other party. Beyond the big bucks and efforts against child poverty, the president is also pushing stricter gun control and comprehensive immigration reform, two of the hottest of hot-button issues. But he left the impression last week, in talking about the importance of ""timing,"" that he wouldn’t allow the rest of his agenda to be derailed by these thorny challenges. Leon Panetta, Obama’s Pentagon chief, told the Post that ""the biggest danger for Joe Biden is wanting to move very fast without bringing the American people with him in terms of some of these objectives."" And that is precisely the kind of overreach that has plagued modern presidents, particularly after they notch their first legislative victory. George W. Bush couldn’t get immigration reform or Social Security privatization. Barack Obama couldn’t get gun control or a host of other initiatives after his first two years. Donald Trump couldn’t repeal ObamaCare or strike an immigration deal. For the moment, the Biden team has to feel good. In an ABC/Ipsos poll, 72 percent approve of his handling of the coronavirus, and only 28 percent disapprove. Three-quarters approval of his handling of vaccine distribution. And six in 10 give him positive marks on the economy. Those are stunning numbers in this era of political polarization. As for the partisan breakdown, 92 percent of Democrats approve of Biden’s vaccination efforts, but so do an impressive 53 percent of Republicans. (He gets lower GOP scores on other questions.) In the same poll, though, 57 percent of those surveyed disapprove of his handling of both gun violence and the border crisis, with the migrant surge likely to get worse before it improves. Matthew Continetti,  , argues that Biden is ""risking Democratic control of Congress"" by pushing massive liberal programs as hard as he has. The piece reviews how presidents going back to FDR, LBJ and Ronald Reagan, despite their early popularity, got clobbered in the midterms. He might have added Bush (2006), Obama (2010 and 2014) and Trump (2018). But Biden certainly likes the Roosevelt analogy, as Axios reported in describing a private session with such sympathetic historians as Doris Kearns Goodwin, Jon Meacham, Michael Beschloss, Eddie Glaude, Walter Isaacson and Michael Eric Dyson. ""In these early days, Biden’s presidency has been less a transformation than a continuation of the partisan stalemate that has existed since the end of the Cold War,"" Continetti writes. ""Parties win elections, misread electoral victories as ideological endorsements, overreach, and pay for it at the polls."" We’re still in the first inning, though obviously, it would take only a handful of seats in the House and one in the Senate to flip control. No one knows how Biden will handle crises to come, just as Trump was optimistic in 2020 before the virus struck. Perhaps Biden is trying to get everything done at once because he knows that political popularity, and legislative advantage, can be fleeting."
https://www.foxnews.com//media/media-root-for-bidens-massive-infrastructure-plan-casting-him-as-fdr,politics,"Media root for Biden’s massive infrastructure plan, casting him as FDR","Hey, is it finally Infrastructure Week? It’s not the sexiest topic, certainly not compared to the bizarre Matt Gaetz investigation or even the Biden dog biting someone again after a stint in reeducation camp. That’s why it became a running joke during the Trump administration, when plans to highlight such an initiative kept getting overshadowed by some controversy or scandal. But President Biden made it the centerpiece of a Pittsburgh speech yesterday, unveiling a plan that will cost, oh, more than $2 trillion—more, in other words, than his just-passed Covid relief bill. Now I’m a fan of infrastructure projects, which help communities, create jobs and can be popular with both parties in a bringing-home-the-bacon kind of way. But the passage of this bill is a crapshoot. Yet some major news outlets are absolutely swooning. Take this headline  : ""With an Eye on History, Biden Moves on Big, Bold and Progressive Infrastructure Package."" Doesn’t that sound like it’s ripped from a White House press release? The piece begins: ""Every day he works from the Oval Office, President Joe Biden stares across from his desk at the portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt he selected to hang above his fireplace."" In case you missed the point: ""Biden hopes to model the more transformational change offered by his acronym'd 20th-century predecessors, FDR and LBJ…He envisions a moment--one where a country ravaged by the pandemic has seen fragilities in the economy exacerbated to a level of unseen hardship--where he can usher in a transformative era…Biden is deeply conscious that it is now his moment to step up."" Do you have the vague impression that CNN is rooting for the president? Okay, it’s historic, it’s filled with goodies, it has echoes of the New Deal. But it’s a massive amount of money and may not pass. The  uses a torrent of statistics to spotlight the plan’s benefits, from mass transit and Amtrak to broadband. That ""would translate into 20,000 miles of rebuilt roads, repairs to the 10 most economically important bridges in the country, the elimination of lead pipes and service lines from the nation’s water supplies and a long list of other projects intended to create millions of jobs in the short run and strengthen American competitiveness in the long run. ""Biden administration officials said the proposal...would also accelerate the fight against climate change by hastening the shift to new, cleaner energy sources, and would help promote racial equity in the economy…The scale of the proposal underscores how fully Mr. Biden has embraced the opportunity to use federal spending to address longstanding social and economic challenges in a way not seen in half a century."" That’s an LBJ reference, if you didn’t do the math. Not until the seventh paragraph does the Times inject this note of reality: ""While spending on roads, bridges and other physical improvements to the nation’s economic foundations has always had bipartisan appeal, Mr. Biden’s plan is sure to draw intense Republican opposition, both for its sheer size and for its reliance on corporate tax increases to pay for it."" Which could, of course, sink the whole thing. Contrast that article with the  . Its headline says: ""White House Unveils $2 Trillion Infrastructure and Climate Plan, Setting Up Giant Battle Over Size and Cost of Government."" At least that gets across there’s a major fight that has two sides. By the third paragraph, the Post cautions: ""The administration’s promises are vast and may prove difficult to enact, even if the effort can get through Democrats’ extremely narrow majority in Congress."" Look, with a 50-50 Senate, Biden can’t pass anything of this scale, even through reconciliation, unless Joe Manchin agrees. And the key question is how to pay for it. Not everyone on the Hill is excited about raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The White House was smart to put out the details before Biden’s speech and frame the issue in advance. But that doesn’t mean the media have to pile on the FDR references and help sell the bill."
https://www.foxnews.com//politics/aclu-expresses-concern-with-vaccine-passports,politics,ACLU vaccine passport concerns suggest unusual common ground with GOP,"The American Civil Liberties Union and some members of the GOP find themselves in rare agreement over the idea of vaccine passports, both expressing privacy concerns and potential government overreach.  ""We also worry that a vaccine passport will encourage over-use. The issues around passport design are separate from the question of where and when people can be required to furnish proof of vaccinations,"" Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, wrote in a blog post on the ACLU’s website Wednesday.  Stanley wrote that it’s likely the vaccine passport system ""will become over-used as people get asked for credentials at every turn."" ""While there are legitimate circumstances in which people can be asked for proof of vaccination, we don’t want to turn into a checkpoint society that outlasts the danger of COVID and that casually excludes people without credentials from facilities where vaccine mandates are not highly justified,"" Stanley continued.  The Washington Post reported on Sunday that the Biden administration has been looking at ways to roll out a vaccine passport program nationwide as more businesses are gearing up to require proof of vaccination to use their services. White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said that the White House’s role is ""to help ensure that any solutions in this area should be simple, free, open source, accessible to people both digitally and on paper, and designed from the start to protect people’s privacy."" Stanley said in a statement to Fox News the ACLU didn’t oppose requiring proof of vaccination ""in certain contexts,"" but that proof must not be exclusively digital and must not allow for tracking other personal medical information.  ""There is also real concern that the creation of vaccine credentials could lead to overuse, or have a chilling effect on immigrant communities and communities of color who are already subject to over-policing and surveillance,"" Stanley said. ""There are legitimate circumstances in which people can be asked for proof of vaccination, but right now not everyone can get vaccinated. That’s precisely what herd immunity attempts to protect against: community spread to people whose medical conditions contraindicate a vaccine or don’t have access. We don’t want a vaccine passport that leads to our most vulnerable people getting further shut out of full participation in our society."" Some Republicans have said they find the idea unconstitutional, while others tied the proposal to voter ID laws. ""Considering that Democrats want to require vaccine IDs for people to conduct their basic daily activities, they now have zero grounds to object to voter ID laws,"" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News. ""If under Democrat logic, you should need an ID to enter even a grocery store, surely there wouldn’t be an objection to showing an ID to legally vote."" Freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., strongly condemned the idea of vaccine passports. ""Proposals like these smack of 1940s Nazi Germany. We must make every effort to keep America from becoming a 'show your papers society,'"" Cawthorn told Fox News. ""The Constitution and our founding principles decry this type of totalitarianism."""

The Georgia election reform bill expands the number of early voting days, allows the observation of ballot counting, prohibits ballot harvesting and continues to allow voters to cast absentee ballots without an excuse, but requires proof of identification, among other measures. A number of Hollywood stars have said they planned to boycott working in the state, an industry hotspot, in protest of the new law. But Gov. Brian Kemp wrote in a Fox News op-ed Wednesday that Democrats have falsely characterized the bill he signed. ""These reforms have nothing to do with ‘voter suppression’ or ‘Jim Crow,’"" he argued. ""The Election Integrity Act makes it easy to vote by expanding access to the polls and harder to cheat by ensuring the security of the ballot box."" In Iowa, SF 413 aims to establish uniform voting protocols across the state’s 99 counties, hold local officials accountable for flouting state rules, allows tabulation to begin before Election Day and regulates absentee ballot drop boxes. The lawsuit there comes as GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who is the certified winner of her election race by a razor-thin six votes, is battling House Democrats for the right to keep her seat. They are claiming that 22 ballots were improperly left out of the count and would have swung the election toward Democratic candidate Rita Hart. Miller-Meeks win was certified by state officials after a recount, but the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives may have final say. ""Democrats are crusading to put Washington in charge of elections, even if it means cancelling out the voters’ voices in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in the name of partisan gains,"" McDaniel and Scott said.

""You can serve all your life. There is no reason you should stop giving and serving."" Tom Cornish lives in the Twin Cities and has been volunteering since he was in high school. Knitting, however, was something he picked up 24 years ago after one of his kids bought him yarn and some loom, his son, Gerald Cornish, told Fox News.  On a good day, Tom Cornish can create a little more than two hats. Each one takes about four hours to complete, he says.  It's no easy task, but if you asked him, he'd joke: ""I've got nothing else better to do.""  His biggest motivation is giving back.  ""If I sit and look out the window, I would get something out of it but no one else would,"" he said. ""When I make hats or once in a while scarfs, someone is going to get a big benefit out of that."" And he's got plenty of yarn to do it. He said he still has three full boxes with other bags in his closet.  The Salvation Army, which has been giving the hats to hundreds of individuals within the Twin Cities, is in awe of his efforts.  ""Tom is an inspiration to us,"" added Lt. Colonel Dan Jennings, commander of The Salvation Army Northern Division. ""Here is a man who just wants to help people, and he is doing it the best way he knows how."" Jennings said Tom Cornish is evidence that ""everyone can do something to help those less fortunate."" And Tom Cornish has no plans of slowing down anytime soon.  ""I'm going to do this until I take my last breath,"" he said. "
https://www.foxnews.com//media/trump-biden-fauci-birx-why-finger-pointing-is-surging-as-covid-19-cases-rise,politics,"Trump, Biden, Fauci, Birx: Why finger-pointing is surging as COVID-19 cases rise","Just as more Americans are getting vaccines, two fierce battles have broken out about Covid-19—one about the current danger and the other about the last administration. It often seems that our political war over the pandemic consumes more energy than fighting the virus itself. And people are understandably confused about the nature of the tunnel we’re in and whether we can see any light at its end. President Biden is once again pleading with people against a premature declaration of victory. And former president Trump is denouncing two of his top medical advisers for criticizing his handling of the crisis, as part of an effort to salvage their own reputations. All this is unfolding as the director of the Centers for Disease Control is warning of ""impending doom."" While there is much reason for hope, says Rochelle Walensky, ""right now, I’m scared."" Scared of a fourth wave of the virus in the next couple of months before a majority of the country is vaccinated. And, by implication, scared of governors, especially Republicans, lifting mask mandates and business restrictions. ""Please, this is not politics—reinstate the mandate,"" Biden said. But of course, these are political decisions, balancing health risks and the need to revive the economy. But the argument over what to do now rests in part on how we got here, 550,000 American deaths later. Trump issued a blistering statement about Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, former leaders of his virus task force, ""two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations… if it were up to them we’d currently be locked in our basements as our country suffered through a financial depression."" The former president was triggered, to use a woke term, by Birx’s interview in a CNN documentary, and the continuing media blitz by Fauci, who is now Biden’s top Covid adviser. But Trump, as is his wont, went well beyond policy to rip the doctors personally. He said that Birx, a ""terrible medical adviser,"" is ""a proven liar with very little credibility left. Many of her recommendations were viewed as ""pseudo-science,"" and Dr. Fauci would always talk negatively about her and, in fact, would ask not to be in the same room with her."" Trump also cited an incident when Birx went to visit family on Thanksgiving after urging the public not to travel. As for Fauci, Trump remains fixated on the 78-year-old having thrown out a lousy first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. Fauci ""said he was an athlete in college but couldn’t throw a baseball even close to home plate, it was a ‘roller.’"" He also said Fauci had done a ""fake"" interview on CNN—I don’t know, I saw him on camera—and that ""the king of ‘flip-flops’ and moving the goalposts to make himself look as good as possible."" So what did the two of them say? Birx told CNN there was an ""excuse"" for the first 100,00 deaths from the original surge, but ""all of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially."" She said she had a ""very uncomfortable"" call with Trump last summer after warning about the virus on the network and was told she had to stay off national TV ""because the president might see it."" Birx is drawing enormous flak for speaking out now, when it’s too late, rather than challenging Trump when she had some authority. Some say she should have quit, though it’s not clear what that would have accomplished. Fauci told CNN that Birx should have done more but was in a difficult situation. Fauci is seen as having diplomatically battled the president last year and has been through many of these cycles. After the infection disease expert did a ""60 Minutes"" interview last October, Trump called him a ""disaster"" and said ""people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots."" Today, by contrast, Biden backs Walensky when she says things like ""impending doom."" But is it impending? The plateau period is over. The seven-day average of new cases topped 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, says the Washington Post. In nine states, the jump has been more than 40 percent in two weeks, says the New York Times. Michigan alone has seen a 57 rise in Covid cases, and a 47 percent increase in hospitalizations, in the past week. I have no doubt that much of this is tied to the warmer weather, spring break gatherings and pent-up frustrations over the past year. Virus variants may also be a factor, as well as states such as Michigan easier limits on business activity. In short, it would be a shame after a year of isolation and lockdown if we had another surge just as enough vaccines are becoming available to protect most Americans by May or June. But there are tradeoffs, as there have been since the dawn of the pandemic. In the end, Biden—and the governors—will be judged on how they handle this crucial period, just as Trump and his advisers were judged on 2020."

In a Tuesday evening  , Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., asked Blinken why he has yet to ""commit to punishing China for its role in the pandemic?"" Banks urged the State Department to seek damages from China and bring the case in front of the International Court of Justice, seated in The Hague. The Chairman’s letter followed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) anticipated report on the origins of the coronavirus, which suggested the virus began by transmitting from one animal to another, but left the actual origins of the virus unclear. The White House condemned the report saying it lacked ""transparency"" and ""crucial data, information, and access,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said following the report’s release Tuesday. ""It represents a partial and incomplete picture."" The Biden administration has criticized China’s unwillingness to allow for a thorough investigation into whether or not the virus was leaked from a Wuhan lab -- as some have speculated since the onslaught of the pandemic, which has killed over 2.8 million people and infected more than 128.7 million worldwide. ""China must pay the burden and the cost endured by Americans because of their role in this pandemic,"" Banks wrote to Blinken. ""Preventing another pandemic is a goal that we all share, but giving China a slap on the wrist after it continued to lie to the world and heightened the severity of the current pandemic is only going to make that goal harder to achieve,"" he added. The Indiana Republican also pressed the secretary of state on whether the U.S. will slap sanctions on China for their actions in the attempted ""cover-up of the pandemic or for spreading harmful disinformation regarding the pandemic.""  Banks pointed to China’s top foreign ministry officials who continue to propagate falsehoods and misinformation surrounding the pandemic, including as recently as Monday. Chinese government spokesman Zhao Lijian deflected questions by reporters on China's transparency regarding the origins of the virus by asking, ""When will the WHO experts be invited to the United States for a visit on origin-tracing?"" Fox News could not immediately reach the State Department for comment."

Desmond said he does not begrudge the children for being educated but wished there would not be such a stark double standard putting his own constituents' children at a disadvantage. ""It's primarily due to the draconian lockdowns by our governor, Gov. Newsom here in California. He hasn't allowed our kids to go back into school. They will be allowed to have limited in person learning here on April 12th. But in the meantime, they are not allowed to be let back into our public schools,"" he said.  ""It's very frustrating. We have 130,000 students in San Diego Unified School District that are not allowed for in-person training right now. And we've got these poor migrant kids who came across the border -- these girls without parents -- and they are being -- I am not begrudging the fact that they should have education but our kid should have that opportunity as well."" Desmond said Newsom effectively ""locked out"" his own constitutents' children from educational opportunities the migrant children are receiving. He added that most of the children being housed at the convention center are females ages 13 -17, and at least 82 have tested positive for the coronavirus. During the interview, host Sean Hannity noted the migrant children are ""lucky"" to have been ""released from [Joe] Biden's cages"" at the Texas border, but that there should be some legal precedent that allows teachers to refuse to educate people who are illegal aliens. ""To my understanding ... we are constitutionally required to educate them,"" replied Desmond. ""They are not leaving the convention center. They are cooped up there for 24 hours a day. They can't get out. All they have is really a cot. I'm not begrudging on the fact, okay, some educational expenses, learning some English."" ""They are here in the country. They are seeking asylum here they've got to be scared to death,"" he continued. ""But really, it's our own parents that are very upset. My office is getting lots of calls from parents saying, hey, we've been fighting to get our kids into schools and get the education in person, and now we are seeing this other population who is here is getting it before we can get it and we have been waiting over a year."""

Abbott plans to visit Weslaco, Texas, a Hidalgo County city of about 41,000 residents, along Interstate 2, just north of the Rio Grande. "" ’s open border policies invite children to take a dangerous trek that exposes them to human trafficking,"" Abbott wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. ""Even   Secretary Mayorkas admitted that many children don’t make it through without harm."" The governor will discuss Operation Lone Star, the plan he launched earlier this month to prevent Mexican cartels from smuggling drugs and people into Texas, according to Border Report. The plan includes beefing up the presence of Texas state police and National Guard personnel in the region, the report said. Abbott’s plan was created following a February meeting with Col. Steve McCraw of the Texas Department of Public Safety, initially to address coronavirus concerns related to the increase in migrants reaching the Texas border with Mexico, according to Border Report. Texas officials became concerned when McAllen Texas, Mayor Jim Darling was told in February by federal officials from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that illegal immigrants traveling with children were now being paroled into the U.S. as part of the Biden administration’s ""catch and release"" system as they awaited their asylum hearings, the report said. Operation Lone Star will involve the use of air, ground, marine and tactical border assets to manage the state’s border region,  . On Tuesday, a group of 10 Texas lawmakers, led by U.S. Reps. Jodey Arrington and Brian Babin, both Republicans, became the latest members of Congress to tour the Rio Grande Valley in Texas to assess the border situation firsthand,  .

Border Patrol did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News. Meadows is not the first Republican to express frustrations with Fauci's silence on the issue. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., wrote in a letter earlier this month calling on Fauci to use his political sway to stop ""a dangerous new foreign pipeline for COVID-19."" ""Hundreds of illegal immigrants"" have been released at the border ""on nothing more than a promise to appear at a future hearing, the letter said, according to   He pointed out that ""Mexico now has the highest per capita COVID fatality rate in Latin America."" There seems to be no love lost between many Republicans and Fauci, who they consider a lifelong bureaucrat who made crucial mistakes at the onset of the outbreak. Fauci’s defenders say these Republicans are merely looking for a designated spear catcher after taking a cavalier approach to masks and lockdowns.  Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, seems willing to provoke them, most recently saying in an interview that his decision to push for a vaccine was one of the best decisions he’s made.

Biden voted to build 700 miles of border protection in 2006. Today he calls them useless, inhumane, and unnecessary. Critics also say the fence is harmful to   and the environment and are urging the president to use the excess cash to restore habitat.

But we can't breathe a sigh of relief until these construction contracts are canceled for good,"" says Laiken Jordahl with the Center for Biological Diversity. ""We need to not just stop building the border wall, but actually begin restoring the land, healing the wilderness areas that have been destroyed by wall construction."" Agents say it’s not just the wall that faces cancellation. Trump ordered a border wall ‘system’ which includes cameras, lights and underground sensors – which provide agents with ""situational"" awareness of the border environment.
