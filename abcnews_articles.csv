Please,"" Biden said Monday. ""This is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And businesses should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously -- precisely what got us in this mess in the first place -- risks more cases and more ... deaths."" Biden's call for the American people to continue using masks to stop COVID from surging is nothing new. He has made the plea in nearly all of his remarks on the virus as president, warning that the country is not yet out the woods even as progress is made on vaccinations. Also on Monday, he announced at least 90% of Americans would be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by April 19, and 90% of the population would have a vaccination site within 5 miles of their homes. But the rollback on restrictions at the state level highlights the competing challenge Biden faces on the pandemic: touting positive signs that hope is on the horizon, while also keeping a country fatigued of COVID-19 regulations and restrictions compliant. White House COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt also had a warning for states Tuesday. ""Lifting all of these restrictions, telling people not to wear masks, gathering in large crowds, that's the equivalent of playing with fire."" Despite the administration's dire warnings, Republican leaders moved forward with plans to do away with statewide mandates on masking. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who last previously extended her state's mask mandate through the end of March, made clear she has no intention of issuing another extension. ""As Gov. Ivey has previously stated, Alabama's mask mandate ends April 9. We have made progress, and we are moving towards personal responsibility and common sense, not endless government mandates,"" Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said in a statement to the Associated Press. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has also previously extended his state's masking requirement, announced Tuesday his plans to immediately lift the mandate. ""This does not mean that the use of the mask will cease,"" Hutchinson argued, adding that ""common sense should govern"" mask usage and private businesses' decisions on masks should still be respected. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who recently signed a bill repealing the state's mask mandate starting April 10, also has no plans to reverse course, his office confirmed to ABC News. In her press briefing Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki sidestepped questions about the impact Biden's message was having, arguing that local leaders and businesses could take action even if governors refused to do so. ""It's a tough message, (but) important for people to hear that we're still in war with this virus, and people need to still be vigilant in order to return to normal,"" Psaki said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now seeing an increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases and people hospitalized with the disease, according to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, caused by increased travel in recent weeks, lifting restrictions and more relaxed behavior. The seven-day average of cases has seen a 10% increase over the previous period and hospitalizations and deaths also have increased. ""I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,"" Walensky said in an emotional plea at a White House briefing Monday. ""We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now, I'm scared."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/vaccinated-travelers-pricier-hotels-flights-76785859,lifestyle,"More vaccinated travelers mean pricier hotels, flights","The cost of travel will slowly rebound from historic lows as more people receive COVID-19 vaccinations and book long-deferred trips, according to industry experts. This time last year, air traffic in the U.S. plummeted, with 95% fewer travelers passing through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints in April 2020 compared with April 2019. This reduced demand led to a corresponding decrease in airfare prices. The average cost of a domestic round-trip ticket in the second quarter of 2020 dropped 28% from the same period in 2019, down to $259, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Few travelers were monitoring these prices at the time since so few were booking flights. But now, with COVID-19 vaccinations opening the possibility of travel to millions more Americans each week , prices are once again set to change. If you’re one of those would-be travelers, experts cautiously advise booking your travel soon. Much remains uncertain, but prices are unlikely to return to 2020 levels. FLIGHT DEMAND SET TO TAKE OFF Experts who track travel deals and consumer interest say demand for airplane seats is likely to increase, driving prices back up. Domestic airfare prices are expected to rise 4%-5% every month until summer 2021, said Adit Damodaran, an economist with Hopper, a travel search tool. “A lot of that is based on the vaccination rollout.” And this increased demand might combine with decreased supply. Airlines scaled back routes and flight frequency in 2020, parking aircraft and furloughing staff. They may be slow to return capacity to pre-pandemic levels, even as bookings pick up steam. “Airlines are burning so much cash, so what we’re seeing is that they’re slowly expanding supply,” said Jesse Neugarten , who founded the flight deal newsletter Dollar Flight Club. “If we have to shut down travel again, they don’t want to get caught in a similar situation as they did in 2020.” HOTEL PRICES MAY RISE SLOWLY Hotel prices have also dropped during the pandemic, though not as uniformly. Room rates in February in New York City were down 37% year-over-year according to Hopper’s data, while small-town hotels saw only a 5% dip. This reflects a larger exodus from crowded cities during the pandemic. This pattern could reverse as vaccinated travelers flock back into metropolitan areas later in 2021, driving prices up. But tourism accounts for only part of travel demand. Business travel, which has all but ceased during the pandemic, will likely be slower to return. This could keep hotel prices low throughout 2021, especially in large cities. It could also suppress airfare prices somewhat, even as more tourists take to the skies. BOOKING FLEXIBILITY LIKELY TO CONTINUE Neugarten, who tracks flight deals, points to a changing travel landscape that extends beyond considerations of supply and demand. The pandemic changed how   and hotels handle flexibility, with many         eliminating change and cancellation fees altogether. This, in turn, has changed the logic for how and when to book travel. “I’m not going to book last-minute because I can get a good deal if I’m booking three months in advance,” Neugarten said. “There’s a lot of incentive to book a deal now because of the flexibility.” Furthermore, the travel trends that mark a typical year remain in flux. Memorial Day and July Fourth travel could follow unusual trends, especially in terms of when bookings will occur. “The traditional events of the year in travel are simply not happening, so there isn’t the same ‘best time to book’ that we would normally see,” said Mark Crossey, travel expert for Skyscanner , a flight search tool. And then there is the question of international travel. Many countries have limited tourists, particularly from the U.S., and these restrictions may remain even as more travelers receive vaccinations. “We’re not expecting an increase in prices for international airfare until May,” said Damodaran. And changing prices are unlikely to be geographically uniform, as countries update their policies one by one. Damodaran noted that Hopper is seeing the strongest interest in Caribbean and Latin American destinations. Uncertainties abound. Vaccine distribution hiccups could dampen prices, as could surges in COVID-19 variants. Flexible booking options, although good for customers, could lead to mass rebookings later in the year. And volatile oil markets could impact airfare prices, as they do in normal years. Despite these unknowns, experts remain cautiously confident that those looking to book 2021 travel should do so sooner rather than later. Greater flexibility reduces the risk of changing plans, and increased travel demand is unlikely to drive prices below current levels. “I booked a one-way (flight) to Portugal in July for $109,” Neugarten says. “We’ll see if I get the vaccination before. If not, I’ll push it out.” —————————————————————————————————————— This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet. Sam Kemmis is a writer at NerdWallet.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/matt-gaetzs-controversial-rise-maga-stardom-faces-renewed/story?id=76799913,politics,Matt Gaetz's controversial rise to MAGA stardom faces renewed scrutiny amid DOJ probe ,"In 2017, both chambers of Congress passed an anti-human-trafficking bill that provided more funds to protect vulnerable women. The vote was nearly unanimous, minus one lone holdout: Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Gaetz's vote at the time puzzled his new colleagues in Congress, and days later, he took to Facebook to defend it on a live stream from his parents' living room. ""I assure you it's not because I don't think human trafficking is a problem,"" he declared. ""It absolutely is. But far too often the best of intentions can lead to mission creep at the federal level."" The conservative rising star, who spent the past three years drawing the spotlight by cutting against the grain, now finds himself gaining attention he didn't seek. And again, the subject is human trafficking. Gaetz sits at the center of a   into potential violations of sex trafficking laws that involves an alleged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, multiple sources confirmed to ABC News. Gaetz turned immediately to the airwaves Tuesday to refute the allegations of a relationship with a minor, doing so in a Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson, who afterward called the segment ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted."" ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Carlson. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" Reports of the investigation into Gaetz, first published by the New York Times, have brought fresh   to the controversial young congressman. Elected to Congress in 2016 after serving in the Florida State Legislature, Gaetz is the scion of a powerful political family in his home state. His father Don served as president of the Florida Senate and has a reported net worth of more than $25 million, according to Florida financial disclosure reports. A frequent guest at   Mar-a-Lago resort, Gaetz, 38, emerged as a fierce defender of the former president who vocally backed Trump through two impeachment trials and repeated Trump's baseless claims of a stolen election in the midst of the attack on the Capitol, even taking to the House floor and falsely suggesting that antifa protesters were behind the riot. ""They were masquerading as Trump supporters,"" Gaetz said. The Florida congressman even traveled to Wyoming to headline a campaign rally targeting fellow Republican Liz Cheney after the congresswoman voted for the former president's second impeachment. Earlier, during Trump's first impeachment trial, Gaetz defended Trump by issuing a menacing tweet targeting Trump's former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen and his wife before Cohen testified before Congress. ""Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot,"" Gaetz tweeted, which prompted the Florida Bar to open an investigation into the congressman's comments. Trump, in turn, has lavished praise over Gaetz at his boisterous rallies, calling him a ""great talent, young, handsome"" and saying that he's ""going places."" Trump also noted at a 2018 rally in Fort Myers, Florida, ""You talk about defending, he's fantastic."" So far, key figures in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr. and the former president himself, have yet to weigh in on the allegations against Gaetz. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial figure herself, defended Gaetz on Twitter Wednesday, calling the investigation a ""witch hunt"" and adding, ""I stand with @mattgaetz."" Gaetz has broken from his party on occasion. In 2019, Gaetz was one of the few members to come to the defense of Democratic Rep. Katie Hill after the House Ethics Committee announced an investigation into allegations that Hill had an extramarital affair with an office staffer. ""This is just absurd. The only person who seems to have a gripe is @RepKatieHill's soon-to-be ex,"" Gaetz tweeted, adding, ""Who among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?"" However, other interactions Gaetz has had with congresswomen have ignited controversy, including repeatedly commenting on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's appearance. Gaetz has called Ocasio-Cortez ""attractive"" multiple times, and in an interview with TMZ, he referenced the dating app Tinder by saying he would ""swipe right"" on the idea of working with her on cannabis legislation. In a Daily Caller segment from 2019 that centered around Gaetz's opinions regarding Ocasio-Cortez, the Florida congressman again commented on her looks, referring to his colleague as an ""attractive lady from Queens."" Later in 2020, when Gaetz revealed for the first time that he had raised a young man from Cuba as his son, the now-former Rep. Hill returned the favor and defended him publicly amid a surge of questions. ""Many of you know @mattgaetz & I have an unlikely friendship,"" Hill tweeted. ""I can't stand a lot of his beliefs but he's been there for me when others haven't. He talks about Nestor more than anything, has done so much for his son & is truly a proud dad."" Gaetz has repeatedly referred to 19-year-old Nestor Galban, the brother of one of Gaetz's ex-girlfriends, as his son -- but has suggested that he never formally adopted him. ""Our relationship as a family is defined by our love for each other, not by any paperwork,"" he told People magazine. Later on an episode of his podcast, Gaetz said he feels ""like a single step-parent at times,"" adding, ""There's a certain kind of love that you can give to another human being, you know, that is not your own flesh and blood, that's not your own kid."" Galban was in the background during Gaetz's 2017 Facebook live stream when he defended his no vote on the anti-human-trafficking bill. ""As you guys can see, I've got my, my helper Nestor over here. I'm in my parents' house out in Walton County,"" Gaetz said."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/capitol-police-officers-sue-trump-physical-emotional-injuries/story?id=76784999,politics,2 Capitol Police officers sue Trump for physical and emotional injuries from Jan. 6 riot,"Two Capitol Police officers filed a civil suit Tuesday against former President   for physical and emotional injuries they say they suffered as a result of the  . In the lawsuit, James Blassingame, a 17-year veteran of the force, and Sidney Hemby, who has served as a Capitol Police officer for 11 years, quote Trump's words leading up to the riot, including Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud and his assertion that Democrats were ""trying to steal"" the  . The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., demands an award of at least $75,000 for each officer for each of the five alleged counts against Trump, as well as punitive damages and costs associated with the litigation. The counts include directing assault and battery, aiding and abetting assault and battery, directing intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violating D.C. statutes against incitement of a riot and disorderly conduct. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Officer Blassingame was one of ""eight or nine"" officers who rioters confronted in the crypt of the  , directly below the rotunda, the suit alleges. ""The insurrectionists were throwing items, and striking Officer Blassingame and the other USCP officers with their fists and weapons,"" the complaint alleges, as a ""front line of insurrectionists was being pressed from behind by waves of newly arriving insurrectionists."" A ""forceful surge of insurrectionists pushed forward and slammed Officer Blassingame against a stone column,"" striking his spine and the back of his head, leaving him ""unable to move,"" the suit alleges. ""Foremost in Officer Blassingame's mind was the terrifying certainty that the insurrectionists were interested in him and the other officers not going home to their families that night,"" the lawsuit claims. The suit also makes a claim similar to what Capitol Police officer   told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas about the racial slurs hurled at officers who were on duty that day. ""For the first time in [Officer Blassingame's] life, people were yelling into his face, calling him a [n-word] repeatedly and throughout the attack in the crypt. He lost count of the many times the racial slur was hurled at him,"" the suit alleges. The allegations in the suit paint an ugly, violent and vivid picture of the attacks it says Blassingame endured. ""The insurrectionists struck Officer Blassingame in his face, head, chest, arms, and what felt like every part of his body,"" it says. ""Insurrectionists used their fists and had weapons that ranged from flagpoles to stanchions and building directional signs, water bottles and other objects he could not identify."" Blassingame's ""sole focus was to do what he could to survive,"" the suit claims. Blassingame alleges that he suffered back and head injuries and ""is haunted by the memory of being attacked, and of the sensory impacts -- the sights, sounds, smells and even tastes of the attack remain close to the surface."" The suit also alleges that Blassingame ""experiences guilt of being unable to help his colleagues who were simultaneously being attacked; and of surviving where other colleagues did not."" Following the attack, Blassingame ""was not able to sleep,"" claims the suit, and he allegedly suffered from ""depression that he could not address because he was too consumed with a sense of continued obligation to continue on with his professional responsibilities."" Because he continues to work in the Capitol, ""he is unable to avoid most of the triggers of his emotional reactions,"" the suit claims. Officer Hemby, the suit alleges, was ""crushed against the doors on the east side trying to hold the insurrectionists back,"" and that the rioters ""continued to scream, 'Fight for Trump,' 'Stop the steal,' and various other slogans, as they struck him with their fists and whatever they had in their hands."" Hemby also endured being ""sprayed with chemicals that irritated his eyes, skin, and throat,"" the suit alleges. The suit alleges Hemby was ""bleeding from a cut located less than an inch from his eye"" and that he ""had cuts and abrasions on his face and hands, and his body was pinned against a large metal door."" As a result of the attack, the suit claims that Hemby's ""left hand and left knee became swollen and painful,"" and that he suffers from back and neck pain and that his skin was burned from being ""sprayed in the face and body with chemical sprays."" Hemby also claims in the suit that he now suffers from trouble sleeping. The lawsuit cites a litany of Trump's tweets and public statements leading up to the attack, including his call for a ""wild"" protest on Jan. 6 and his promotion of ""the baseless idea that Vice President Mike Pence could single-handedly reject the election outcome based on false claims that some states wanted to 'decertify' or 'correct' election results that were not in Trump's favor."" The suit also cites the words of a number of prominent Republican lawmakers who place the blame for the riot on Trump, including Sen. Mitt Romney, Rep. Liz Cheney and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who after voting to acquit Trump on the charge of inciting the insurrection, took to the Senate floor on Feb. 13 and made clear his belief that Trump was responsible for the Capitol riot. ""There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" McConnell said. ""The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president, and having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth."" What McConnell said next is also cited in the suit, in support of how Trump may still be held accountable for his actions even though he's no longer in office. ""President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office, as an ordinary citizen, unless the statute of limitations has run, still liable for everything he did while in office, didn't get away with anything yet -- yet,"" McConnell said. ""We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one."""

But President Joe Biden's two-phase   will carry a larger price tag along with potentially greater implications. The president is set to start outlining his proposal Wednesday in Pittsburgh -- the same city where he   -- in the midst of a defining challenge to his vow to ""change the paradigm."" The action will be primarily, if not exclusively, inside his own party. Both Biden and Democratic congressional leaders are   Republican buy-in, and they know that even bending or changing Senate rules only matters if Democrats are almost entirely on board with the plan. That plan will include billions upon billions for things like roads, bridges and broadband. Billions more would flow toward what progressives have categorized as ""human infrastructure"" -- paid family leave, college access, housing, elder care -- all while seeking to deliver on climate-change and social-justice goals. As for how it would be funded, pockets of Democrats are already staking out territory about what new taxes should be in and what should be out. While some   and   massive tax hike -- albeit one aimed at the rich and corporations -- others are already saying the president should be spending more as opposed to less. ""We think there is ample room to get the number up,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the House Progressive Caucus, told reporters Tuesday. Biden's proposals will be scored, amended and picked apart. But if he is to make good on what he's promising, he'll need to navigate complex intra-party dynamics to get to the payoff. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is doubling down on the sweeping voting legislation he   last week as the fallout from it continues. Calls to boycott Georgia-based companies are growing and the arrest of a Black state lawmaker inflamed an already fierce response. In an interview with Atlanta   Tuesday, Kemp criticized his opponents who describe the law as voter suppression that disproportionately impacts voters of color. He dismissed organizations pointing to Georgia's record of discriminatory voting practices and diminished   about equitable access to the ballot box as a form of  ""cancel culture."" ""I knew what was coming from the other side. I knew that they were going to try to do this boycott, cancel culture and everything else,"" Kemp said. Kemp maintained that the bill makes it ""easy to vote and hard to cheat,""   this week by civil rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and other organizations interprets the new law very differently.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/south-dakota-governors-ban-transgender-athletes-center-emerging/story?id=76793497,politics,South Dakota governor's ban on transgender athletes at center of emerging GOP culture war,"A series of culture wars that are likely to resurface on future campaign trails appear to be emerging in several Republican-led states   of transgender rights, despite the next two cycles of elections being several  . South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem -- who is widely considered to be a possible 2024 presidential aspirant -- is the latest official to be at the center of debates surrounding a groundswell of bills that aim to ban transgender students from playing on school sports teams according to the gender with which they identify. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, similar types of bills have made their way through more than a dozen states, including   laws in Tennessee and Mississippi. Noem's attempt to take on the highly sensitive topic had a rocky start, despite her having expressed initial excitement at the prospect of ""defending women's sports"" in signing HB 1217 --  her state's version of a bill that sought to ban transgender women and girls from playing on female sport teams. This week, Noem killed that bill after failing to come to a compromise with state lawmakers regarding revisions to what she called ""serious drafting errors"" which she believes made the bill ""significantly different from any other state legislation pending across the country."" In a letter addressed to the state's legislative leaders on Monday, Noem expressed her concerns over the bill's language having consequences beyond protecting ""fairness in women's sports."" The concerns included worries that the bill would have ""turned any failure to make a sports team into a litigation hazard,"" while also implementing the need for parents to complete a yearly ""onerous paperwork requirement"" to identify school-aged children's genders and whether their child had taken performance-enhancing drugs. Noem also pointed to the bill's likely impact on collegiate athletics, which could have put state athletes at odds with the oversight implemented by national athletic organizations. ""South Dakota has shown that our student athletes can compete with anyone in the country, but competing on the national stage means compliance with the national governing bodies that oversee collegiate athletics,"" Noem wrote in a series of recent tweets. ""While I certainly do not always agree with the actions these sanctioning bodies take, I understand that collegiate athletics requires such a system -- a fifty-state patchwork is not workable."" Although the South Dakota governor's two executive orders do not explicitly include references to transgender athletes, they do refer to ""current policies that allow males to participate in women's athletics."" Noem said the orders ""temporarily address the problem"" and that she wants to see a special legislative session come together in the coming months to further address these issues through legislation. While Noem and other supporters of similar efforts see these policies as vehicles for protecting their notions of fairness in women's sports, the political push in South Dakota appears to be at odds with the current number of trans athletes it would presumably impact. According to data provided by the Transformation Project, a transgender youth advocacy group in South Dakota, there are only a handful of trans athletes across the state -- among them are five trans male athletes and no trans girl athletes. The evolution of Noem's stance on her state legislature's initial bill opened the door for intraparty criticism. Some social conservatives like the Family Policy Alliance seized on her perceived presidential aspirations by implying that her decision to oppose the bill could have larger political repercussions. ""It's no secret that Gov. Noem has national aspirations, so it's time she hears from a national audience,"" the group wrote in a press release to supporters. Editors at  , a conservative news magazine, called Noem's moves a ""disappointing capitulation"" and alleged the governor engaged in ""a flagrant violation of her powers"" for making ""sweeping substantive changes rather than small stylistic ones"" in her executive orders. The editors went on to call it a ""classic case of a politician motivated by immediate financial incentives (in this case, avoiding expensive lawsuits and potential boycotts) acting rashly on an issue she knows and cares little about, only to quickly realize that this was drastically out of step with her party and her base, and then frantically set about justifying her decision."" Noem stood her ground in a subsequent   published by the magazine. As LGBTQ advocates laud the outcome of the political back and forth, they indicate more work needs to be done to address trans rights. ""Nobody wins when politicians try to meddle in people's lives like this. Nobody wins when we try to codify discrimination like this. We're thrilled with the decision by South Dakota lawmakers to kill this bill,"" said Jett Jonelis, an ACLU of South Dakota advocacy manager in a statement following the termination of HB-1217 earlier this week. Following Noem's announced executive orders, Jonelis pushed back on the governor's notion of protecting ""fairness in women's sports"" in a statement to ABC News. ""If Gov. Noem really wanted to protect fairness in women's sports, she would tackle the actual   such as severe underfunding, lack of media coverage, sexist ideologies that suggest that women and girls are weak, and  ,"" Jonelis said. For now, it appears that at least one factor in the legislative saga could offer room for common ground -- according to Jonelis, the South Dakota ACLU is also currently examining whether the governor ""exceeded her authority by issuing these executive orders."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-questions-ncaa-limits-student-athlete-compensation/story?id=76791975,politics,Supreme Court questions NCAA limits on student athlete compensation ,"With   in full swing, the   on Wednesday faced off against a group of   at the U.S. Supreme Court in a long-running dispute over limits on education-related  . The NCAA and its biggest, most lucrative   want the justices to overturn a ruling abolishing the limits, saying it would erode the amateur nature of college sports and open the door to ""pay for play.""  argue the rules unfairly suppress their ability to be rewarded for valuable skills and abilities in violation of federal antitrust law. The case is one of the biggest tests in decades for the NCAA and its limits on athlete compensation, and it could dramatically alter the nature of college sports, some experts said. While the NCAA allows schools to provide full tuition, room and board for athletes, it places limits on education-related benefits such as computers, paid internships and summer abroad programs which can value tens of thousands of dollars. ""In the present world, as the district court recognized, we permit student athletes to receive the 'actual and necessary' educational expenses,"" NCAA attorney Seth Waxman told the justices during oral arguments in the case. ""And the (lower) court said 'no, you can't place any limit on that' ... that permits schools to allow pay for play."" Waxman argued that amateurism is a defining feature of college sports and that lifting caps on compensation would create ""a regime in which student athletes can be paid large sums of money on account of their athletic performance, which does not distinguish college from professional sports."" A majority of justices appeared concerned by the association's position. Chief Justice John Roberts noted the tens of thousands of dollars in insurance policies some schools pay for their athletes. ""Doesn't that undercut amateurism?"" he said. Justice Clarence Thomas noted the disparity between coaches' salaries and what players are allowed to receive. ""it strikes me as odd that the coaches' salaries have ballooned and they're in the amateur ranks as are the players,"" Thomas said. Justice Samuel Alito showed empathy for athletes, who he said ""lead a pretty hard life"" and face ""shockingly low graduation rates."" ""So the argument is they are recruited, they're used up and they're cast aside without even a college degree. So they say, how can this be defended in the name of amateurism?"" Alito said. Justice Elena Kagan accused the NCAA of ""very high-minded"" talk of amateurism when the schools have essentially ""gotten together into an organization that has undisputed market power and they use that power to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels."" Justice   said plainly that ""anti-trust law should not be a cover for exploitation of student athletes."" But several justices also voiced support for the association's need to maintain a distinction in college sports. Roberts worried aloud that rolling back too many limits on student athlete compensation could be ""like a game of Jenga."" ""You pull out one log and then another, and everything's fine, then another and another and all of a sudden the whole thing comes crashing down."" ""I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run,"" added Justice Stephen Breyer. Thomas said he was ""perplexed"" about how to ensure ""an important distinction between student athletes and professional athletes without (the NCAA) constantly being involved in litigation."" The athletes' attorney, Jeffrey Kessler, repeatedly sought to assure the court that the nature of college sports would not be altered by ending the cap on education-related expenses covered by schools. ""We heard over and over again that each loss was going to destroy college sports … it's never happened,"" Kessler said. ""We're not challenging any restrictions or rules regarding that they have to be students. And, in fact, the education-related benefits here would help them to succeed as students."" The court is expected to hand down a decision in the case by the end of June."

Gaetz's alleged sexual relationship with minor, feds looking beyond Florida, sources say","The federal investigation into Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is focused on allegations that the junior congressman had a sexual relationship with at least one minor, and is scrutinizing the Republican's conduct not only in Florida but outside the politician's home state too, three sources familiar with the investigation tell ABC News. The investigation, first reported by the New York Times Tuesday and  , has sent shockwaves through Republican circles, particularly among close associates of former President  , who considered Gaetz a staunch ally and loyal friend. ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview Tuesday night. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" Sources told ABC News the investigation has been going on for months and began during the Trump administration. Former Attorney General Bill Barr was briefed on the investigation's progress several times, the sources said. One source told ABC News that federal authorities have already interviewed multiple witnesses as part of their probe. Gaetz has reportedly told confidants he is considering retiring from Congress and possibly joining the right-wing media outlet Newsmax, according to   earlier Tuesday. Yet within the last several weeks Gaetz started reaching out to prominent attorneys, according to one source. The source said that one of the attorneys Gaetz asked to represent him was Washington attorney Bill Burck, who represented Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus and Don McGahn during the Mueller probe. Burck turned down the case, according to a person familiar with the decision. On Fox News Tuesday night, Gaetz appeared to confirm the investigation when he said he was approached by someone who claimed he could ""make this investigation go away."" ""There was a demand for money in exchange for a commitment that he could make this investigation go away along with his co-conspirators,"" Gaetz said, identifying the alleged extortionist as former DOJ official David McGee. The law offices of Beggs & Lane, where McGee is now employed as a private attorney, denied those allegations in a statement Wednesday night. ""The allegation by the Congressman is both false and defamatory,"" the statement read. ""Mr. McGee was the Chief Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida 25 years ago. During his tenure with the Department of Justice his reputation for integrity and ethical conduct was impeccable. It has remained impeccable throughout his 25 year tenure with our firm. While he was with the DOJ he would never have entertained a scheme such as what Congressman Gaetz suggests nor would he today. Unsubstantiated allegations do not change that fact."" One source familiar with the matter confirmed that the FBI and Justice Department are separately investigating Gaetz's allegations that he was the target of an extortion attempt."

Duckworth reached a 'trigger point' with White House over AAPI representation,"After reaching a ""trigger point"" with the White House over Asian American and Pacific Islander representation in the Cabinet, Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth is ""very pleased"" with the response  She told ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl and Political Director Rick Klein that the ""trigger point"" that caused her to threaten to block Biden's nominees was a White House representative bringing up Vice President Kamala Harris to convince her the Cabinet was diverse enough. ""I said 'whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute, I love Kamala she's my sister,'"" she said. ""'She's brilliant, and she and I came into the Senate together. And she is as Asian as I am, we're both half Asian. But you would never say to the Black Caucus, you have Kamala, there's no need to nominate any more members of the Black community to key Cabinet positions. I mean, you wouldn't even say, hey, you've got a white male president, there's no need to have any more white males in the Cabinet -- right? So why would you say that to Asians?'"" ""I think that is illustrative of the otherness (in how) AAPI's have been treated in this country,"" she added. ""And I do talk about that in the book where I say, you know, you're always sort of like the other. You're always having to prove that you're American enough, that you're part of this country."" The Illinois senator's new memoir, ""Every Day is a Gift,"" came out March 30. The book shares stories from her life including her recovery after an RPG shot down her helicopter in Iraq and took both of her legs. She also discusses her experiences as a senator, including ""Babygate,"" when she fought to bring her newborn onto the floor of the Senate, and her experience as an Asian American woman in America. Duckworth raised the issue of diversity in Biden's Cabinet following an increase   since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. ""And I will tell you that the White House heard me,"" she said. ""They responded within 24 hours, and they said 'absolutely, and we're starting by putting a very senior staffer in the West Wing who will have the ability to say to the president or have the ability to say to his key advisers, 'wait a minute, you've overlooked this,' and that person will be of AAPI descent.'"" Duckworth also discussed President Joe Biden's  n on ""Powerhouse Politics."" The proposal, which is expected to cost $2 trillion, includes funding for modernizing transportation infrastructure, eliminating lead pipes and expanding broadband access. ""This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime efforts that is going to really bring America back to the status of a global leader economically and creates just so many jobs in this country that are so badly needed right now,"" she said. Duckworth said parts of the plan will pay for themselves, like fixing leaking water pipelines. She added that the plan could be paid for through increasing the gas tax, although a gas tax increase is not in Biden's proposal. ""It was actually the trucking industry that came to us and said 'we're spending more money stuck in road congestion and fixing and repairing our trucks because of the bad quality of the streets in this country,'"" Duckworth said. ""'We would rather raise the gas tax, and pay that because that will save us money in the long run.'"" When Karl pressed Duckworth on the gas tax, noting that it would impact all Americans, including those with low incomes, she pointed to tax credits as a way of alleviating that pain. ""I don't have a problem with going and revoking the tax cuts for the ultra-rich and for large corporations that the Republicans passed just a few years ago. That will not affect working families in this country,"" Duckworth said. ""So there are ways to do this. I'm happy to be bipartisan about it, but the key thing here is that if we don't do this, it's going to cost us more in the long run, in terms of losses to businesses, in terms of where the country will be, in terms of not having the jobs that we need."" Duckworth also shared her experience during the Jan. 6 insurrection and connected it to the title of her book, which she called ""a love letter to America."" ""Betrayal is the best that I can describe how I felt and how I still feel today,"" she said. ""But after all that, this democracy, this country, despite all of our divides and what happened then, is still worth it. We are-- it's still worth working towards that more perfect union."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/tampa-bay-buccaneers-rb-job-open-leonard-fournettes/story?id=76773378,sports,Tampa Bay Buccaneers RB job open despite Leonard Fournette's playoffs,"TAMPA, Fla. -- Four days after the           re-signed running back          , who went from a backup during the regular season to 448 scrimmage yards in four postseason games, coach Bruce Arians said he is leaving the door open for who will start in 2021. ""No. That will all be defined through practice and OTAs and training camp and preseason,"" Arians said Tuesday. ""There are no starters. This is a new football team. I made that message clear when they left, that that team won the Super Bowl. This team hasn't done sh--. All those things will be defined in practice."" It was a different tune from when Fournette first signed with the club in Week 1 of the regular season last year, and Arians made it clear that Ronald Jones would be the starter, something he reiterated throughout the season. It wasn't until Jones suffered a broken finger that required surgery and was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list that Fournette saw starting action in Weeks 15-17. That action continued when Jones suffered a quad injury just prior to the wild-card game at Washington, allowing Fournette to earn the moniker ""Playoff Lenny,"" and later ""Lombardi Lenny."" Fournette started all four postseason games. ""Those guys. They all know what the system is. The best players are gonna play,"" Arians said. ""Obviously we had two really, really good ones at that position, and I really like          . I think with an offseason, he's gonna have a breakout year also. All those roles will be defined when we get to the last week of the preseason."" When asked about wide receiver          , their only key free agent who has not been re-signed, and how quickly he hopes to have that position resolved, either by re-signing Brown or adding an outside free agent, Arians said, ""[We're] just gonna take our time. There's offers out there, and we'll see how it goes."" Arians said that, just like last year, the team would consider drafting a quarterback to develop behind          , even at No. 32 in the first round. ""We go into that every year. If the guy is there at the right time that we really think has a great future, and no better time than to have one sit for a couple years and learn from those two guys -- each round, there's gonna be one of those guys in that picture to try to see who's the best available right then."" Arians also provided an update on tight end          , who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in Week 4, just as he was getting into a groove with Brady. ""Yeah, he's real close,"" Arians said. ""He's not running on the grass yet, but he's really close. The last time I checked, he was 80, 85% bodyweight running on Ultra G, and he looks fantastic. I don't see any setbacks. If and when we can get together this offseason program, on the field, he'll be ready to go. What a huge addition to have him back because he was having a great year. ... The sky's the limit for what he can do in this offense."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-big-push-massive-infrastructure-plan-proposed-tax/story?id=76770525,politics,"Biden unveils sweeping infrastructure plan, calling it a 'once-in-a-generation investment in America'","President   on Wednesday unveiled what he has called his  , a roughly $2 trillion   plan to modernize thousands of miles of roads, fix thousands of bridges, expand broadband access and replace all lead pipes carrying drinking water. ""It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh. ""It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II."" To pay for it, he is proposing trillions of dollars in   on corporations -- making a traditionally bipartisan issue one expected to trigger Republican opposition. He said he would invite Republicans to the Oval Office and ""listen to them"" and their ideas about how to pay for his proposals. The president also faces headwinds from progressive Democrats who do not think the spending package is large enough, as well as more centrist Democrats who feel the opposite. Balancing their competing interests will prove essential as the Democratic leadership pushes a bill through a Congress it only very narrowly controls. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told colleagues Monday she hopes to pass it by July 4, if not later that month, according to a person familiar with her comments. ""I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say, 'This was the moment that America won the future,'"" Biden said Wednesday, decrying the state of U.S. infrastructure compared to other countries. ""What I'm proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America's future, spread largely over eight years. It will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally and create more revenue as well."" Biden's spending plan, he said, will create millions of jobs. He detailed the first part during a speech in industry- and union-centric Pittsburgh, where he also kicked off his campaign in 2019, pledging to restore the middle class. ""Two years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to 'rebuild the backbone of America,'"" Biden said, calling himself a ""union guy."" ""And today, I return as your president to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that."" The president proposed pairing the decade's worth of spending with a series of tax hikes on corporations, which the White House said will pay the full infrastructure costs over 15 years. Biden proposes raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a return to the level before the 2017 GOP rewrite of the tax code. His plan would also increase taxes on multinational companies' profits abroad and would eliminate subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, among other ideas. On a call with reporters Tuesday night, an administration official wouldn't say if Biden plans to send one entire package or separate proposals to Congress. The official also wouldn't say when any of the proposed infrastructure projects could potentially get started. When asked how many jobs the proposal -- which is being called the ""American Jobs Plan"" -- would create, the official would not provide a specific number, only saying it would ""create millions and millions of jobs."" Biden said he planned to roll out a second component of his proposal later in April, which press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday would center on ""creating economic security for the middle class through investments in child care, health care, education and other areas."" That part could total more than $1 trillion in additional spending, according to people familiar with a Tuesday briefing for top senators on congressional committees who will be involved in crafting the package. In recent months, Biden has signaled that he would pay for future spending proposals by raising taxes not just on corporations but on wealthy individuals, too. Biden had previously said that Americans making over $400,000 per year would see their taxes increase and that he supported taxing capital gains as normal income, which are not among the ideas the White House proposed this week. An administration official told ABC News that ""the focus of this plan is on corporate tax reform,"" and Biden reiterated Wednesday that those making less than $400,000 annually would not see an increase. ""No one, let me say it again, no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period,"" he said. ""This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe American -- in American capitalism."" It's possible that those tax proposals could appear alongside next month's spending proposal. The package is separated into four areas: transportation, home, care and research-and-development infrastructure. Among the proposals is $621 billion in updates to modernize roads, rails, ports, airports, mass transit and highways; $100 billion to eliminate 100% of lead pipes; $100 billion to build out high-speed broadband across the country; $400 billion for community-based care for elderly Americans and a $180 billion investment in clean energy. It also includes $174 billion to spur job growth in the electric-vehicle market and create a national network of 500,000 electric-vehicle chargers by 2030. ""They are among the highest-valued investments that we can make in the nation,"" Biden said, arguing they would improve the country's competitiveness. He invoked the space program more than once, noting nearly 2,000 impactful products and services it generated and implored Americans ""to imagine again"" ""The rest of the world is closing in, and closing in fast,"" Biden said. ""We can't allow this to continue. An American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal, non-defense research and development spending on record."" As president-elect, Biden laid out ""a two-step plan of rescue and recovery"" -- the first, his   relief proposal, a version of which became law this month, and the second, what he called his ""Build Back Better"" plan. That plan, he said in January, ""will make historic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy. Investments in the caregiving economy and in skills and training needed by our workers to compete and win the global economy of the future."" Biden has prioritized the major spending plan, the first half of his package, as he seizes on any early momentum after pushing the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package through Congress. But with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the House -- he can only afford to lose eight Democratic votes -- and an evenly split Senate, it remains to be seen whether the infrastructure package could pass through Congress. While improving airports and roads typically find bipartisan support, the Biden administration's plans to fund improvements through tax increases could turn off most, if not all, Republicans, and potentially even some Democrats. The coronavirus relief package was popular among Americans, including Republicans, but it did not garner a   in Congress. As it did with the relief package, the White House has similarly leaned into popular support for infrastructure improvements -- a sign it is prepared to use, and will try to shape, public opinion as a cudgel to bring lawmakers on board. Another threat came this week from several New York-area House Democrats who want to see Biden lift the cap on the deduction for state-and-local taxes, known as SALT, imposed by a law then-President Donald Trump signed in 2017. Doing so would benefit suburban homeowners, although some progressive Democrats could balk at the notion of a tax change that would benefit relatively wealthier Americans. ""If SALT is not included, I'm not voting for any changes to the tax code,"" Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., told ABC News this week. ""We all put our different interests about different issues on the back burner for the American Rescue Plan because it was so important that we all come together on it."" On Tuesday, Suozzi issued a statement with two other Democrats, Reps. Bill Pascrell and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, opposing any deal that does not reverse the cap on the SALT deduction. ""We say, 'No SALT, no deal,'"" they said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, too, on Wednesday said he would ""fight hard"" to get the SALT deduction caps lifted, although the New Yorker backed Biden's infrastructure plan and touted the jobs the White House said it would create. Biden's plan does not reverse the cap on SALT deduction. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Tuesday that the group would not take a position on lifting the cap, but added, ""I'm not sure that our members will see it as some of the fundamental reforms to the tax system that would make the system more fair."" The White House has indicated that Biden would be willing to negotiate on potential new taxes that are sure to be unpalatable to Republicans and Democrats alike. ""The president has a plan to fix our infrastructure and a plan to pay for it,"" Psaki said Monday. ""But we are also open to having that discussion, and we certainly expect to have the discussion with members of Congress, as we move forward, about areas where they agree, where they disagree, where they would like to see greater emphasis or not."" Biden has said he wants to attempt to pass a major infrastructure package as his second priority -- before legislation on immigration or gun reform, for example -- because he thinks the current, divisive political climate may be more tolerant of a spending plan could help the United States ""compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs."" ""It's a matter of timing,""   last week. But if Republican support does not materialize this time either, Schumer's office this week hinted at the possibility Democrats in that chamber could try to push through the president's proposals through a budgetary process known as ""reconciliation"" -- the same way they passed Biden's COVID-19 relief bill. That process would allow for a simple majority -- including Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote -- to pass Biden's bills, unlike the 60 votes normally needed. But that step would require the support of all 50 Senate Democrats -- far from guaranteed after centrists have expressed a desire for prioritizing bipartisanship this time around. Asked on Tuesday night's call if the White House hopes to use reconciliation to push the package through, an administration official would only say, ""this is the beginning of a process"" and would be reaching out to Republicans and Democrats. Biden could also face competing pressures inside his party on the overall size of the package, with Jayapal and other progressives encouraging the White House to think bigger. ""The Biden proposal on the campaign trail was significantly larger than what's been discussed so far,"" Jayapal said. ""We really think there's ample room to get the overall number up to somewhere in that range (of $6.5 trillion and $11 trillion over the next 10 years) in order to really tackle the scale of investment that we need to make."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/nfl-owners-approve-17-game-season-2021/story?id=76773900,sports,NFL owners approve 17-game season for 2021,"NFL owners approved the expansion of the regular season to 17 games Tuesday, a long-expected decision that will generate additional revenue for the country's richest sports league. Players agreed to the additional game as part of their 2020 collective bargaining agreement, which gave the league an option to expand as soon as the 2021 season. The preseason will be reduced from four games to three to maintain compliance with the collective bargaining agreement, which limits the total number of preseason and regular-season games played to 20. There will remain one bye week per team. The season will begin on Thursday night, Sept. 9 and will end on Jan. 9, 2022. The Pro Bowl will be played on Feb. 6, 2022 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas and the Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles has been pushed back one week, from Feb. 6 to Feb. 13, 2022. ""This is a monumental moment in NFL history,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. ""The CBA with the players and the recently completed media agreements provide the foundation for us to enhance the quality of the NFL experience for our fans. And one of the benefits of each team playing 17 regular-season games is the ability for us to continue to grow our game around the world."" The formula for scheduling a season with an odd number of games will consist of two parts. First, AFC and NFC teams will alternate annually between eight and nine home games. The AFC will have nine in 2021. The extra game will be a cross-conference matchup based on the previous year's divisional standings and the division schedule rotation from two seasons prior. The full 2021 schedule will be released later this spring. The NFL said that the enhanced season will guarantee that, starting in 2022, each team will play an international game at least once every eight seasons. Up to four neutral-site games will be scheduled with the initial focus on Canada, Europe, Mexico, South America and the United Kingdom. The league said interested teams can also volunteer to play home games internationally as they currently can do. Although the NFL Players Association agreed to the change last year, some players have spoken out on social media in recent weeks to express their displeasure with their additional game. On Sunday,            running back           tweeted it was ""dumb ... as hell"" and           safety           tweeted: ""We really let this happen."" Player salaries won't change, but they will be paid over 18 weeks rather than 17. Some player benefits will be altered, however. The owners' decision to activate the 17-game option will trigger changes to offseason and in-season workouts, according to NFLPA assistant executive director of external affairs George Atallah. Among them is a reduction in the maximum amount of time players can be required to spend at a team facility during the season. The NFLPA has been advocating since December to make last year's virtual offseason permanent as a way to reduce wear and tear on their bodies. Tuesday's approval came one year after owners expanded the playoff field from 12 to 14 games, a decision that created two additional playoff games and was estimated to generate $150 million in additional annual revenue. Most NFL revenues are split with players according to the terms of the CBA; the addition of the 17th game pushes the players' distribution to 48.5% of shareable revenues. Assurances of this expansion were baked into new media distribution rights the league announced earlier this month with Amazon, CBS, ESPN/ABC, FOX, and NBC. According to multiple reports, those deals will bring the NFL and its players more than $100 billion in revenue between the 2023 and 2033 seasons. The NFL has played 16-game seasons since 1978, but some owners have been pushing to expand for more than a decade. The league came close to imposing it in 2014, without an agreement from players, but ultimately tabled the plan to save it as a bargaining chip for next CBA."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/older-americans-largely-vaccinated-covid-19-cases-younger/story?id=76777363,politics,"With older Americans largely vaccinated, more new COVID-19 cases among younger adults","As more older Americans get vaccinated an increasing number of new   cases are impacting younger adults,   that   in an effort to prevent more people from becoming sick. The number of new COVID-19 cases increased more than 10% in 26 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico since last week, a possible signal that the country is on the  . And for the first time, the majority of new hospitalizations have been younger adults, with cases among people ages 50-65 increasing more than those older than 65, who are more likely to have been vaccinated. And in some states, like Michigan and Massachusetts, the number of cases among older children, teenagers and young adults have also increased. At the same time recent data showed a 96% decline in COVID-19 cases in nursing homes since the vaccine rollout began in December, indicating high vaccination rates are helping protect older populations. Dr. Nick Gilpin, chief medical officer for Beaumont Health system in Michigan, said the average age of their COVID-19 patients is 46 years old. ""A lot of these individuals have been doing all of those things that we’ve been warning about: gathering together in large groups, going to bars and restaurants,"" he told ABC News. Public   experts say a more serious spike in cases can still be prevented, but only if everyone doubles down on protections like wearing masks, avoiding indoor gatherings, refraining from nonessential travel and getting vaccinated as soon as possible. ""I so badly want to be done. I know you all so badly want to be done. We are just almost there, but not quite yet,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said in  Walensky and other public health officials said cases are increasing because people began to relax their behavior while there was still a lot of the virus spreading in the country, particularly newer variants that can spread more easily. As more states have relaxed restrictions and more people have been traveling, the virus has taken advantage of more opportunities to spread. ""The rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases in teens and young adults is very troubling. Tragically, states -- like Massachusetts -- ignored the advice of public health officials and re-opened too quickly,"" said Sam Scarpino, an assistant professor in the emerging epidemics lab at Northeastern University. ""As a result we're at risk, entering another surge and delaying our safe return to normalcy,"" Scarpino added. Twenty-six states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have seen an increase of over 10% in the number of new cases since last week. New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Connecticut currently hold the highest case rates per 100,000 people over the last seven days. Hospital admissions are also increasing in nearly a dozen states. As more states push to reopen schools and businesses the increased activity also creates more opportunities for the virus to spread among younger groups that have thus far not been seen as at high risk for severe illness. ""Not many states make age data available over time, but in the few that do, older children -- 10-19 -- and young adults are making up a larger fraction of the cases. This likely reflects a combination of widespread vaccination among older adults and increased mobility among young people, through school reopening and more community activities,"" said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Rivers said a new surge among younger adults wouldn't necessarily lead to increases in hospitalizations and deaths like the trend with  . ""Through most of the pandemic, hospitalizations and deaths have tracked closely with cases. But now that nearly three in four people over the age of 65 have had at least one dose of the vaccine, we’ll start to see that change. I expect that even in places where cases surge, we won’t see as many severe cases as we would have six months ago,"" she said. But Walensky and other public health officials said even if a ""fourth surge"" in cases affects more younger adults, they're still concerned about any increase in how much the virus is spreading. ""There are plenty of reasons to not want to have COVID outside of just the deaths alone,"" Walensky said in an interview on MSNBC on Monday night. ""We know that about 10% of the population that gets sick with COVID has long haul syndrome, has symptoms beyond three weeks, cardiac challenges, depression and mental health challenges, pulmonary challenges, renal failure, clotting. So there's a lot we don't understand about this disease, and we shouldn't want to have it circulating whether or not it leads to mortality,"" she continued."

Houston lawyer Tony Buzbee has filed 19 civil lawsuits against Watson on behalf of women who allege inappropriate behavior and sexaul assault during massage sessions with the Texans quarterback. Three of the lawsuits filed Sunday night accuse Watson of ""purposely"" touching the women with his penis and state that his ""behavior is part of a disturbing pattern."" ""We're certainly cognizant and aware,"" Caserio told the Texans All Access podcast. ""We made a statement at the beginning about where the organization stood. I would say it's a legal situation, it's a legal process, so we're certainly respectful of that. ""We certainly take them very seriously. The allegations, what's been discussed, are certainly troubling. And organizationally that's not something that we can condone, that we condone, those types of actions."" Caserio's comments on Watson's situation are the first by a member of the team. Head coach David Culley has not spoken to the media since the first lawsuit was filed March 16. The team has released two statements and said in one that it would stay in close contact with the NFL during its investigation under the league's personal conduct policy. Watson has publicly denied any wrongdoing, and Watson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said last week that he believes ""any allegation that Deshaun forced a woman to commit a sexual act is completely false."" Hardin also said in a statement last week that his law firm has ""strong evidence"" showing that one of the lawsuits alleging sexual assault is false and that it ""calls into question the legitimacy of the other cases as well."" Buzbee said in an Instagram post on Tuesday night that he's filed two more lawsuits against Watson; lawsuits filed after 5 p.m. CT generally don't appear until the next morning on the Harris County District Clerk's website, so it's unclear if they've been submitted. Buzbee said earlier this month that he would submit affidavits and evidence from several women to the Houston Police Department and the Houston district attorney. Buzbee also said he will request that a grand jury consider the evidence and determine whether charges should be brought against Watson by the state of Texas. Dane Schiller, a spokesperson for the Harris County district attorney, said last week that it would be ""inappropriate"" for the DA's office to comment on the lawsuits against Watson. ""It would be inappropriate for the District Attorney's Office to comment on a civil lawsuit, and we refrain from publicly discussing allegations in any matter until and if a criminal charge is filed; we do this out of fairness to all,"" Schiller said in a statement."
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/leonard-fournette-playoffs-create-tampa-bay-buccaneers-rb/story?id=76774413,sports,Leonard Fournette playoffs create Tampa Bay Buccaneers RB competition,"TAMPA, Fla. -- When           signed with the           in Week 1 last season, coach Bruce Arians said that           was still his starter at running back. He reiterated that throughout the season. But after Fournette, who re-signed four days ago, had 448 scrimmage yards in four postseason games on the way to a Super Bowl title, Arians is leaving the door open on who will start in 2021. ""No. That will all be defined through practice and OTAs and training camp and preseason,"" Arians said Tuesday. ""There are no starters. This is a new football team. I made that message clear when they left, that that team won the Super Bowl. This team hasn't done s---. All those things will be defined in practice."" Last season, Fournette didn't see starting action until Weeks 15-17 after Jones suffered a broken finger that required surgery and was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list. That action continued when Jones suffered a quad injury just prior to the wild-card game at Washington, allowing Fournette to earn the moniker ""Playoff Lenny,"" and later ""Lombardi Lenny."" Fournette started all four postseason games, and now he has a chance to start this season. ""Those guys. They all know what the system is. The best players are gonna play,"" Arians said. ""Obviously we had two really, really good ones at that position, and I really like              . I think with an offseason, he's gonna have a breakout year also. All those roles will be defined when we get to the last week of the preseason."" Jones rushed for 978 yards on 192 carries (5.09 average) and seven rushing touchdowns during the regular season, with 28 receptions and 165 receiving yards. Fournette had 367 yards on 97 carries (3.78 average) and six rushing touchdowns during the regular season, with 36 receptions and 233 receiving yards. But in the postseason, Fournette had 82 touches in four games for 448 scrimmage yards and four touchdowns. Jones, who was back to playing in the divisional game at New Orleans, had 139 scrimmage yards on 35 touches in three postseason games, with no touchdowns. Fournette averaged 4.69 yards per rush in the postseason while Jones averaged 3.97. When asked about wide receiver              , their only key free agent who has not been re-signed, and how quickly he hopes to have that position resolved, either by re-signing Brown or adding an outside free agent, Arians said, ""[We're] just gonna take our time. There's offers out there, and we'll see how it goes."" Arians said that, just like last year, the team would consider drafting a quarterback to develop behind              , even at No. 32 in the first round. ""We go into that every year. If the guy is there at the right time that we really think has a great future, and no better time than to have one sit for a couple years and learn from those two guys -- each round, there's gonna be one of those guys in that picture to try to see who's the best available right then."" Arians also provided an update on tight end              , who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in Week 4, just as he was getting into a groove with Brady. ""Yeah, he's real close,"" Arians said. ""He's not running on the grass yet, but he's really close. The last time I checked, he was 80, 85% bodyweight running on Ultra G, and he looks fantastic. I don't see any setbacks. If and when we can get together this offseason program, on the field, he'll be ready to go. What a huge addition to have him back because he was having a great year. ... The sky's the limit for what he can do in this offense."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/nfl-owners-approve-17-game-season-starting-2021/story?id=76774908,sports,"NFL owners approve 17-game season, starting in 2021","NFL owners approved the expansion of the regular season to 17 games Tuesday, a long-expected decision that will generate additional revenue for the country's richest sports league. Players agreed to the additional game as part of their 2020 collective bargaining agreement, which gave the league an option to expand as soon as the 2021 season. The preseason will be reduced from four games to three to maintain compliance with the CBA, which limits the total number of preseason and regular-season games played to 20. There will remain one bye week per team. The season will begin on Thursday night, Sept. 9, and will end on Jan. 9, 2022. The Pro Bowl will be played on Feb. 6, 2022, at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, and Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles has been pushed back one week, from Feb. 6 to Feb. 13, 2022. Speaking shortly after owners concluded the first day of a two-day virtual meeting, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the decision to expand was a ""monumental moment in NFL history."" He also cited league data that had traced the highest rate of player injuries to preseason games. (Many of those who play extensively in preseason games are backups and other players unlikely to make the team.) ""What we are actually doing is following the data and following the science to make sure that we are doing things [well] both from a health and safety standpoint as well as seeking to get better in every way,"" he said. The formula for scheduling a season with an odd number of games will consist of two parts. First, AFC and NFC teams will alternate annually between eight and nine home games. The AFC will have nine in 2021. The extra game will be a cross-conference matchup based on the previous year's divisional standings and the division schedule rotation from two seasons prior. The full 2021 schedule will be released later this spring. The NFL said that the enhanced season will guarantee that, starting in 2022, each team will play an international game at least once every eight seasons. Up to four neutral-site games will be scheduled with the initial focus on Canada, Europe, Mexico, South America and the United Kingdom. The league said interested teams can also volunteer to play home games internationally as they currently can do. Chris Halpin, the NFL's executive vice president and chief strategy and growth officer, said that Germany is among the countries that could host a game in the coming years. Although the NFL Players Association agreed to the change last year, some players have spoken out on social media in recent weeks to express their displeasure with their additional game. On Sunday,            running back           tweeted it was ""dumb ... as hell,"" and           safety           tweeted: ""We really let this happen."" Player salaries won't change, but they will be paid over 18 weeks rather than 17. Some player benefits will be altered, however. The owners' decision to activate the 17-game option will trigger changes to offseason and in-season workouts, according to NFLPA assistant executive director of external affairs George Atallah. Among them is a reduction in the maximum amount of time players can be required to spend at a team facility during the season. The NFLPA has been advocating since December to make last year's virtual offseason permanent as a way to reduce wear and tear on their bodies. The league is working on a plan for this year's offseason program, which will be affected in at least some way by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a Tuesday memo obtained by ESPN, the league informed teams that OTAs for all teams will begin April 19. (In previous years, teams with new head coaches were allowed to begin two weeks earlier than others.) OTAs remain voluntary for all players, per the CBA; COVID-19 testing protocols established last year will remain in place; and workout bonuses in player contracts must be paid as specified in those contracts. The league and the NFLPA expect to continue, over the next 10 days, discussion of other matters regarding the offseason program, including whether OTA meetings will be held virtually or in person, what the requirements and restrictions will be for on-field participation, and other matters. The memo states that if no agreement is reached between the league and the players' union on those issues, current CBA guidelines will govern 2021 OTAs. Tuesday's approval came one year after owners expanded the playoff field from 12 to 14 games, a decision that created two additional playoff games and was estimated to generate $150 million in additional annual revenue. Most NFL revenue is split with players according to the terms of the CBA; the addition of the 17th game pushes the players' distribution to 48.5% of shareable revenue. ""Since players share the revenue that is brought into the NFL, more money for the NFL means more money for the players as well. The new CBA also increases the players' revenue share as part of the negotiated media kicker, which comes into effect when we play 17 regular season games. As a result, players will see even larger revenue increases in future years, when the new media revenues really begin,"" the NFL Players Association said in a statement. Assurances of this expansion were baked into new media distribution rights the league announced earlier this month with Amazon, CBS, ESPN/ABC, Fox and NBC. According to multiple reports, those deals will bring the NFL and its players more than $100 billion in revenue between the 2023 and 2033 seasons. The NFL has played 16-game seasons since 1978, but some owners have been pushing to expand for more than a decade. The league came close to imposing it in 2014, without an agreement from players, but ultimately tabled the plan to save it as a bargaining chip for next CBA."

The extension is worth up to $68.7 million, his agency tweeted Tuesday. That includes the $2.316 million salary from the last year of Miller's rookie deal, a fifth-year option worth $10.88 million, and the three new years on the deal, which can be worth $18.505 million per year if he hits certain incentives, the source said. The deal includes $42.6 million guaranteed at signing, according to a source, and keeps the 2018 first-round pick with the team through the 2025 season. The Raiders revamped their offensive line this offseason, trading away center          , guard           and right tackle          .

The team also re-signed guard           to a two-year deal and brought back 37-year-old           at a reduced rate. Miller has played in 46 games in his three-year career, all of them starts. The Raiders drafted Miller 15th overall in 2018, the first selection of head coach Jon Gruden's second stint with the franchise.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrat-rita-hart-ends-election-challenge-close-iowa/story?id=76796759,politics,Democrat Rita Hart ends election challenge in close Iowa House race,"Democrat Rita Hart announced she's withdrawing her challenge to the results in Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, ending a   over the last contest of the 2020  . Hart dropped her petition before the House panel tasked with overseeing the review, according to a statement released Wednesday, amid intense pressure from both sides. ""After many conversations with people I trust about the future of this contest, I have made the decision to withdraw my contest before the House Committee on Administration,"" she said, citing ""the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years."" ""It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility,"" she added. GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks was   in November by a mere six votes out of 400,000 cast, marking one of the closest House races in modern history. She was seated with the rest of Congress in early January, taking the oath of office and representing the southeastern Iowa district despite Hart moving forward with a petition in the House. Hart asked the House panel in December to probe the results after a recount and certification, bypassing the courts and calling for a hand recount of all votes -- including 22 ballots that were excluded from the official tally. Her legal team centered their case on those excluded ballots, saying that they were legally cast and should be counted and would ultimately hand her a victory if they were included. ""Since Election Day, and throughout this entire process, my mission has been about ensuring the voices of Iowans who followed the law are not silenced. I am saddened that some Iowans’ votes will not count through no fault of their own. The work of ensuring it does not happen again will continue beyond this campaign,"" Hart said in the statement ending her challenge. But a pursuit in Congress was a politically fraught maneuver, with Republicans mounting a pressure campaign against Democrats for trying to reverse the election outcome and framing the challenge as an attempt by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to ""steal"" a Republican seat and pad her slim majority. ""The race is over. I understand people get upset when they lose, but the idea that you want to come in and play a political game is concerning to me,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at a press conference in Iowa, just hours before Hart's announcement. ""We have elections and people need to have trust and faith and confidence in their elections,"" Miller-Meeks said earlier on Wednesday alongside McCarthy. ""If six votes aren't enough to win an election, then why are six members on a committee able to overturn an election."" After Hart officially dropped her challenge, McCarthy celebrated Miller-Meeks' victory, saying in a statement, ""Rita Hart and Nancy Pelosi finally heard what many Iowans told me today: Mariannette Miller-Meeks is the duly-elected Congresswoman serving Iowa’s Second Congressional District."" The GOP's efforts to cast Democrats as trying to invalidate certified election results comes after spending months supporting former President Donald Trump's attempt to reverse his electoral defeat last year. McCarthy voted alongside 138 House Republicans against certifying the presidential results from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Democrats, including Pelosi, pushed back by drawing a contrast between Hart's challenge -- which followed a legal process outlined by federal law and focused on 22 ballots to back up their claims -- and Trump's fruitless effort based on unsubstantiated allegations of fraud. Throughout the protracted process, one of the most significant wrinkles for Democrats was within their own ranks, as some moderate members balked at the prospect of overturning the election results if a vote came to the House floor. ""Losing a House election by six votes is painful for Democrats. But overturning it in the House would be even more painful for America. Just because a majority can, does not mean a majority should,"" Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn.,   earlier this month. It's not unusual for an election to be contested before the obscure committee: there have been 110 cases filed since 1933. But overturning an election is a rare outcome: over nearly 90 years, only three of those cases resulted in the declared winner being removed and replaced, according to the committee, and in one, the seat was left vacant. New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of House Democrats' campaign arm who is charged with defending Democrats' majority in next year's midterm elections, said in a statement after Hart's announcement that he respects the former Iowa state senator's decision and pledged that Democrats will continue to fight for voters. ""From the day she announced her candidacy, Rita Hart has shown that she is a tireless advocate for the people of Iowa. I respect her decision and applaud her efforts to ensure that every legal vote was counted in this election. I know her service and commitment to Iowans won't end here,"" Maloney said. ""While Republicans have been throwing up roadblocks to the ballot box at every turn, Democrats will always fight to ensure every American can vote and that every legal vote is counted."""

Speaking to reporters after the first day of a two-day virtual meeting of owners, Goodell said: ""All of us in the NFL want to see every one of our fans back. Football is simply not the same without fans, and we expect to have full stadiums in the upcoming season."" Some of that expectation is based on factors beyond the NFL's control. The league never established an attendance cap while playing during the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, deferring instead to individual teams in conjunction with state and local regulations. Attendance dipped more than 90% compared to 2019 and a total of 1.2 million fans were included in attendance counts for the entire regular season and postseason. League revenues fell accordingly. In some cases, the NFL will need local municipalities to sign off on attendance plans in order to fully open up their stadiums for 2021. Vaccine rates might also play a factor. A total of 18 NFL stadiums are in use as mass vaccination sites and to date, 1.5 million shots have been administered at those sites, according to the league. NFL chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills said last week that the league would encourage but not require players, coaches and staff to be vaccinated. The league and the NFL Players Association are continuing to negotiate the terms of the offseason program, which the league told teams would begin April 19. The NFLPA is advocating for a fully virtual offseason, similar to what the league transitioned to in 2020, while owners would like players back in the team facilities for traditional minicamps and OTAs."

""I think the level of excitement for me is at an all-time high,"" Drummond told reporters Tuesday over a videoconference call following his first full practice with the team since          . It will be Drummond's first game action since Feb. 12, after which the           took him out of the lineup while trying to find a trade partner to move the nine-year veteran center. While Drummond characterized the long layoff as ""crazy,"" he sounded confident about where his conditioning was at following his first practice session in Los Angeles. ""I felt incredible,"" he said. ""I wasn't winded."" Drummond told the Mason & Ireland Show on ESPN 710 Los Angeles on Monday that he ""lost about 10 to 15 pounds"" during his time away from the court, adding, ""right now, I'm probably in the best shape I can be in."" Drummond's addition to the starting unit calls into question what Gasol's role will be moving forward.           already occupies the backup center position and has been one of the Lakers' most consistent players, averaging 15.2 points on 63.8% and 6.8 rebounds in 25.3 minutes per game.

""Marc's had a difficult run with the health and safety protocols and some other things,"" Vogel said. ""He's loved here. These guys respect him so much. He's been a true pro in handling this. We're going to need all three of our centers throughout this playoff push, this championship run, hopefully. And he's a true pro."" Vogel said he has not had any talks with the 13-year veteran about a potential buyout. Drummond, 27, will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and Vogel said the franchise intends to re-sign him. ""That's certainly what we're hopeful for,"" Vogel said. ""The summer will play out, and we'll let that happen when it happens. But we want him to help us during this championship run this season, but we're hopeful that he's a Laker for a long time to come. That's what we're envisioning, that he's gonna be a key piece for us, both in the short term and the long term."" Perhaps planting the seed for a future contract, Lakers governor Jeanie Buss posted a series of photos to her Instagram account on Monday depicting her late father, Dr. Jerry Buss, with former Laker great           and Drummond and herself sharing a similarly warm moment.

""It's an honor to be in this facility, to be able to step onto that court where these legends have played and built such an incredible legacy here in L.A.

Official Bert Smith was alert as he was placed on a stretcher and moved off the court at Lucas Oil Stadium. The NCAA said he left the game with a medical issue. On the TBS broadcast, rules analyst Gene Steratore said Smith was feeling lightheaded and was being tended to in the locker room. Smith was not transported to a hospital, according to the NCAA. ""He's a great official, great person,"" Gonzaga head coach Mark Few said after his team's 85-66 win to advance to the Final Four. ""I mean, I was just shocked and scared for him, but I was able to stick my head in there a little bit and see that he was talking and coherent and tried to say a quick prayer for him and just wished him the best."" Smith was standing on the baseline in front of the Gonzaga bench as the Trojans were moving onto offense when he collapsed and hit his head on the floor. Medical professionals surrounded Smith on the court as players, coaches and staffers moved toward their respective benches. Bulldogs players were instructed to look away while Smith was on the ground. Smith stayed on the floor for about five minutes before standing up and moving to a nearby stretcher. The game resumed with standby referee Tony Henderson replacing Smith."

""After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it's evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives. That is wrong,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo sent to all Delta employees worldwide. His   praised aspects of the new law, and said it ""improved considerably during the legislative process."" Hours later, Coca-Cola's CEO joined Delta's in condemning the legislation, calling it a ""step backwards"" in an interview with CNBC. ""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied, and we will continue to advocate for it, both in private and now even more clearly in public,"" Quincy said. ""The reality is many things are improved and done and achieved in private without having to take a public stand, but in this case, it does not work, clearly, and so we're being more forceful in our public position."" Quincy's rebuke went much further than another top Coca-Cola executive's did in a   Monday. Coca-Cola did not take a public stance on the bill before it passed, but Monday's statement said the company was ""disappointed in the outcome."" Since Gov. Brian Kemp signed the Republican-sponsored   into law Thursday evening, voting rights activists from a broad coalition of more than 50 groups have ramped up their   Georgia-based businesses. Some leaders are even calling for boycotts. LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter -- one of the coalition groups leading on this issue -- told ABC News Wednesday she was glad that Delta and Coca-Cola changed their stance, and while she said the work is harder now because the bill has passed, she believes these corporations have the ""political muscle"" to make a difference not just in Georgia, but nationwide. ""I'm hoping that they really do recognize ... that not coming out earlier was a missed opportunity, but that in fact they have an opportunity now,"" Brown said. ""(They can) send a clear message that as a company, they adamantly stand against the bills in Georgia and all bills that seek to suppress the vote, and that they're going to use their political capital and leverage to actually prevent voter suppression and stand for democracy."" Delta and Coca-Cola's repositioning also comes as 72 Black executives penned an open letter, which ran as a full-page ad in Wednesday's  , calling on corporate America  to stand in public opposition to any legislation that would restrict voting access, and specifically, Black voters' access to the ballot. ""Make no mistake, we have seen this playbook before,"" the letter read. ""As Black business leaders, we cannot sit silently in the face of this gathering threat to our nation's democratic values and allow the fundamental right of Americans, to cast their votes for whomever they choose, to be trampled upon yet again."" Before the Georgia bill passed, activists had called on major corporations based in the Peach State to publicly oppose the omnibus elections bills being considered by the General Assembly, which they said was directly aimed at suppressing Black voters and other historically disenfranchised communities. But most corporations did not, instead opting to issue general statements supporting fair, accessible and secure elections. Delta and Coca-Cola received much of the post-signing blowback. Wednesday morning, before the executives articulated clearer positions against the bill, Hannah Gebresilassie, a co-founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA, told ABC News that both companies' ""watered-down statements"" were ""extremely disappointing."" ""We expect them to stand up for people across this nation, when injustices are facing our lives,"" Gebresilassie said. ""We want to see Coca-Cola and Delta put their money where their mouth is. Y'all better be helping pay for voter mobilization efforts in the next few months because we have a lot of educating to do with this bill being passed."" On Wednesday afternoon, a group of voters, Black church leaders and activists from Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project Action Fund and #ProtectTheVoteGA held a rally in front of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, whose president and CEO   of support for several provisions of the bill, but recognized that ""concerns remain."" Despite the rain, the demonstrators showed up to demand accountability from business leaders on the issue of voting rights. Attendees handed out water to people walking in and out of the building, which under the new elections law volunteers can no longer do for voters waiting in sometimes hours-long lines. Other provisions in the bill that activists have blasted include a shortened early voting period for runoffs, a ban on out-of-precinct voting until 5 p.m., limitations on ballot drop box accessibility and the new ability for voters to make an unlimited number of challenges to other voters' eligibility. Some of the same Georgia corporations being targeted over the elections law responded stood united with the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020, when activists and allies protested against racial injustice following George Floyd's death in police custody. Both Coca-Cola and Delta came out in support of that racial reckoning. A ""Black Lives Matter""   at Delta's headquarters. Coca-Cola made a racial equity commitment plan, and a   is still on the company's Twitter account. ""They need to understand how strong the correlation is, right? If you're saying Black lives matter, you also need to say that Black votes matter,"" Crystal Greer, the other co-founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA, told ABC News. Brown said companies joining the movement that followed Floyd's death was a ""positive move forward,"" but she said now, companies who did so need to make clear that it was not a ""marketing exploitation opportunity."" ""It is one thing to in the heat of the moment, to say that I stand and I acknowledge this is wrong (but) I think it also has to be more than transactional. It has to be a transformative change,"" Brown said. ""What are their values as companies around racial justice and racial equity?

Suggs said he'd planned to congratulate Bueckers -- the two are former high school stars from Minnesota -- for the achievement but instead left their conversation feeling inspired for his regional final matchup the following night. ""Last night, [Bueckers] said some things that really helped me,"" said Suggs, who finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in his team's 85-66 win over USC in the Elite Eight. ""I've been kind of struggling, trying to get my footing in these tournament games. Of course, seeing her go out there and play great like she did and then talking afterward ... she kind of said some words, it kind of got me uplifted, got me going. Definitely helped tonight."" Suggs entered Tuesday's game with 14 turnovers combined in his three previous contests. He finished with three against USC, his lowest tally in the NCAA tournament. While he showed poise in the Elite Eight matchup, he lacked that calm watching Bueckers' game on Monday. Suggs said he was ""extremely nervous"" and ""pacing back and forth"" until the final buzzer. ""I couldn't sit down,"" he said. Now, Suggs and Gonzaga will take the next step toward completing the first perfect season since the 1975-76           achieved the feat. Since then, the four teams that entered the NCAA tournament with a perfect record -- Indiana State in 1979, UNLV in 1991, Wichita State in 2014 and Kentucky in 2015 -- failed to win the national championship. But coach Mark Few said his team is not focused on history. He said he wanted it to celebrate its Elite Eight victory and then move on to its next game against UCLA. ""Everyone wants us to keep moving forward, but that's not how we roll,"" he said after the game. ""This is a heck of an accomplishment. We're going to take it and savor it for what it is. That doesn't lessen our desire to win this game, the next game or win two more games. We're wise enough to know these are really, really special times. These are great accomplishments, and they need to be celebrated. That's how we're approaching it right now. Enjoying the heck out of it."" Tuesday's game was an impressive showing by the Bulldogs against a USC squad that had dominated Kansas and Oregon on its way to the Elite Eight. But a Gonzaga team that made 50% of its shots and outscored USC 46-32 in the paint overwhelmed the Trojans. Now, the pursuit of perfection continues. Suggs entered the postgame news conference with a souvenir around his neck: Few had given him the largest piece of the net he cut down after Tuesday's win. Suggs said he wasn't sure if he was supposed to wear it around, but Few told him to ""keep it."" While the team isn't looking too far ahead, Suggs said it's difficult to avoid considering the possibility of an undefeated season. ""It's hard not to think about it,"" Suggs said. ""We try to keep our minds off of it and keep focused on the task at hand. It's a great accomplishment to be mentioned with those teams because they're amazing. Again, we just come in every day to play to the Gonzaga standard and for each other. I mean, this is the result that we get from that."""

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/ucla-bruins-outlast-michigan-wolverines-reach-final-ncaa/story?id=76783042,sports,UCLA Bruins outlast Michigan Wolverines to reach Final Four of NCAA men's tournament,"INDIANAPOLIS -- First Four to Final Four. , which was one of the last four at-large teams selected to the NCAA tournament and earned an 11-seed, became the first team since VCU in 2011 to advance from the First Four to the Final Four, holding on to upset top-seeded           51-49 on Tuesday night. The Bruins move on to face overall No. 1 seed            on Saturday. ""Unreal, man. Unreal. I love every single one of these guys,"" UCLA guard           said. ""It's incredible, man. Surreal. Surreal. Something growing up, you just dream about. And to do it with such an amazing group of guys, such incredible staff, such incredible coaches, makes it just so wonderful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful sharing this moment with your brothers and just great, great people. Incredible."" The Bruins led for most of the final 25 minutes of the game, but a missed           3-pointer in the final minute and Juzang going 1-for-2 from the free throw line with six seconds remaining opened the door for Michigan. The Wolverines first went to           with 11 seconds left, but he air-balled the go-ahead 3-point attempt. After Juzang missed his second free throw, Michigan's           had a pull-up 3-pointer rim out, and Wagner's desperation 3 at the buzzer didn't fall either. ""We got the look, got the shot that we wanted,"" Michigan coach Juwan Howard said. ""Unfortunately there's not much you can do with 0.5 seconds, but that shot was a nice little heave. Unfortunately it just didn't go in. Before that we got an open look and just fell short, but overall, I love the fact how our guys executed down the stretch."" Juzang was UCLA's main source of offense for most of Tuesday night, scoring 14 of the Bruins' first 16 points and finishing with 28 points. He left briefly after landing awkwardly following a rebound, but he got his right ankle retaped and reentered the game. Juzang single-handedly kept UCLA in the game during the opening stretch when Michigan had a seven-point lead and the Bruins couldn't get anything going on the offensive end. Juzang, combined with a terrific game plan from Cronin, enabled UCLA to claw back into the game and enter halftime with a four-point cushion. ""Just approached it like another game,"" Juzang said. ""We've been super locked into this tournament. As a player, you don't like to add pressure to yourself. I know the whole team was just worried about 'we're going to leave it out there on the floor and we're going to give it everything we've got.' I mean, the shots just happened to go in and teammates were finding me."" Cronin rotated           and           at the center position, helping limit Michigan big man            on the interior. The Bruins' defense forced Michigan to create offense in isolation situations, with the Wolverines getting very little from off-ball movement. And, once again, the pace of the game was being played in UCLA's favor. Unfortunately for Michigan, none of that changed in the second half. UCLA jumped out to a nine-point lead before Juzang hurt his ankle and Michigan regained the momentum. The Wolverines took a one-point lead on two occasions, but UCLA -- like it did after Alabama's           sent Sunday's game to overtime with a buzzer-beating 3 -- took its punches and fought back. ""To find a way to beat them with defense the way we did tonight, obviously extremely proud of our team,"" Cronin said. ""It was just resilience. ... I think that stat sheet can get crumbled up tonight."" When Cronin was picked to replace Steve Alford the day after the 2019 national championship game, it wasn't a universally acclaimed hire. There were questions about Cronin's fit, not only for a Midwest native moving to the West Coast, but in terms of how the grind-it-out style he used at Cincinnati would work at a blueblood school like UCLA. ""April 9th, 2019, I told you, I spell fun W-I-N,"" Cronin said. ""You have to find a way to win, and these guys are having the most fun they have ever had in their life back in that locker room because they won. I told them I was going to teach them how to win."" The Bruins finished strong in Cronin's first season and were a bubble team entering the final days of the 2019-20 season before the NCAA tournament was canceled. And there was plenty of optimism entering year two, before bad luck hit Westwood. Five-star point guard Daishen Nix opted to go to the G League instead of enrolling at UCLA;          , arguably the team's best player, tore his ACL in the middle of the season; and           has missed the past two months due to personal reasons. UCLA lost its last four games leading up to the NCAA tournament, including a quarterfinal loss in the Pac-12 tournament to Oregon State. The Bruins started the NCAA tournament down by 13 points to Michigan State late in the first half; at the time, ESPN's win probability for UCLA was 12.2%. But the Bruins came back to beat the Spartans in overtime, knocked off BYU and Abilene Christian by double-figures, then knocked off 2-seed Alabama in overtime to advance to the Elite Eight. ""We've had our ups and downs during the season, but it's such a beautiful thing, the way that we have come together for this postseason,"" Juzang said. ""It's just a feeling of everybody's just so unified. It's like one unit, and we're just all sharing in each other and rooting for each other. I mean, I think that's why we're at this point and just playing for each other. Just a lot of love, man. We're not done yet. But so far, it's been beautiful, the ups and downs, and that makes moments like this even more special."" After UCLA's win over Alabama on Sunday night that sent the Bruins to the Elite Eight, Cronin made it clear he wasn't content without a trophy. ""Somebody said, 'Well, now you've been to an Elite Eight.' That's not why I came to UCLA,"" he said on Sunday. ""I've got a lot of friends in the NBA, they make fun of people that have rings that say conference champion. There's only one. Whoever wins the NBA title is the world champion. So for me, we've got to win three more games."" One down, two more to go. First up will be one of the toughest tests of Cronin's career: Unbeaten Gonzaga.

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/msg-barclays-center-welcoming-fully-vaccinated-fans-back/story?id=76635382,sports,"MSG, Barclays Center welcoming fully vaccinated fans back, other businesses likely to follow","Across the country, tens of millions of Americans received a tangible bill of   following their vaccinations against the  . And in New York's biggest arenas, that vaccination card will be their ticket back to indoor events. This week, Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center will be the first major indoor sports venues to allow fans who show proof of full vaccination to purchase tickets to NBA and NHL games, albeit with limited seating and a mask mandate. Ben Diamond, a Knicks and Rangers fan who started the blog  , that has chronicled the city's sports fans' thoughts and experiences during the pandemic, told ABC News that he and other fans were relieved when the arena announced the plan. ""I'd personally feel better going to the Garden if I was fully vaccinated, and knew that others had their shots,"" said Diamond, 25, who received his first vaccine shot last week. Public health experts and business experts predict that more indoor businesses will ask for vaccination confirmations from customers as more locations begin reopening. However, they warned that such a program would not immediately bring their businesses back to pre-pandemic times, as millions of Americans are still waiting for their shots and thousands of new COVID-19 cases are still recorded daily. Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, told ABC News that MSG and Barclays Center's strategy is effective since it doesn't rely heavily on vaccination rates to safely allow fans inside. The arenas are only at 10% capacity, and any ticket buyer that is not 14 days out of their second shot will have to present a negative   test, according to  . All fans must also adhere to the mask mandate, regardless of their vaccination status. ""I do think people do have to understand that any time you have to gather indoors, outside of your immediate family, you are assuming a risk, but the risk [at MSG] is manageable,"" Winslow told ABC News. Winslow said other sports locations will likely be instituting similar policies during the spring and summer if they want to welcome their fans back safely -- but it may take time. ""Right now, with such a small percentage vaccinated, it's going to be a few months before you see these policies adopted on a widespread basis,"" he predicted. Lauren Bock Mullins, an assistant professor of management at the College of Staten Island, told ABC News the policy will likely go beyond sporting events. Indoor businesses that have been most impacted by the pandemic, such as movie theaters, concert halls, shops and restaurants, have been yearning to get their customers back without spreading the virus, she said. In many cities and towns, those businesses have reopened and have strict health policies, including limited seating and mask mandates. Mullins said a proof of vaccination option may be used by bigger businesses and chains first, but smaller mom-and-pops will be keeping their eyes on the plan's effectiveness. ""If they do it well, I don't see why others would not want to follow suit,"" Mullins told ABC News. Public health experts warned that businesses that do impose a policy that allows for more vaccinated customers to enter a venue need to be careful. Philip Alcabes, the director of the public health program at Hunter College, said that the country's vaccination rate is moving at a good pace nationally, but there are still some counties that are lagging behind, particularly in lower-income and minority neighborhoods. Proof of vaccination policies, at this point, would accentuate the vaccine inequality on an economic level, Alcabes said. ""These sorts of systems that require people to show proof of something always invite opportunities to have inequities,"" Alcabes told ABC News. The professor added that there is still the threat of rising cases from the COVID-19 variants, and people need to stick to social distancing, even if they already received their shots, until more people are vaccinated. Alcabes said if indoor businesses do start implementing the proof of vaccination policy, people who have been hesitant to get the vaccine may do so, if only to begin resuming their normal lives. Diamond said he has heard from a lot of sports fans in the New York area who are more than willing to get their shots and return to their pre-pandemic activities. He said fans feel a sense of appreciation and acknowledgment when they see rewards being offered to those getting vaccinated. ""Some fans will say, 'OK I don't want to miss out on this,'"" Diamond said. ""They feel they've done a good job being safe."""

Lockett was entering the final season of a three-year, $31.8 million extension he signed in 2018. He has had his three best seasons since then, with 28 receiving touchdowns (fifth among NFL wide receivers) and 3,076 yards (13th). The $17.3 million new-money average in Lockett's extension ranks 10th among NFL wide receivers, according to Spotrac.com. Lockett, 28, was a third-round pick by Seattle in 2015. He made the Pro Bowl and was a first-team All-Pro as a returner in his rookie season, then came back from a compound leg fracture late in the 2016 season to start every game in 2017. He has since supplanted the retired Doug Baldwin as Seattle's No. 1 receiver. Last season, Lockett and           became only the second pair of Seahawks receivers in team history to each top 1,000 yards in the same year. With Metcalf a year away from becoming eligible for what is expected to be a massive payday, there was no guarantee that Seattle would reinvest in Lockett with a third contract. Lockett was set to have the third-largest cap hit of any Seahawks player in 2021 at $14.95 million. His extension lowers that number to around $7 million, a source told ESPN. That gives Seattle some needed breathing room against the cap and is one reason for the timing of Lockett's extension, which comes much earlier in the offseason than when the Seahawks typically do new deals for players who are under contract. Quarterback           and Baldwin celebrated Lockett's extension on Twitter: Lockett has shown a          .

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/supreme-court-questions-validity-amateurism-ncaas-business-model/story?id=76794069,sports,Supreme Court questions validity of amateurism in NCAA's business model,"The justices of the Supreme Court of the United States questioned whether amateurism is an essential part of the NCAA's business model Wednesday during a landmark hearing for the future of college sports while also expressing concerns about starting a slippery slope of judicial rulings that could lead to the destruction of an American tradition. The Supreme Court heard more than 90 minutes of oral arguments Wednesday morning in the NCAA v. Alston case, the first time the nation's highest court has weighed in on the business of college sports in nearly four decades. The question in front of the court is whether the NCAA deserves special relief from normal antitrust rules in order to protect its educational mission and preserve a tradition of amateurism in college sports. The court is expected to make a ruling sometime in late spring or early summer. A federal district court judge decided in her ruling in the Alston case in 2020 that the limits NCAA member schools mutually agree to place on what each school can provide to its athletes in compensation are illegal. The judge's ruling opens the door for athletes to receive unlimited benefits as long as they are related in some way to education. That includes items such as classroom equipment, study abroad travel, funding for post-graduation internships and cash payments for academic achievements. The NCAA appealed the judge's ruling, arguing that the loose guidelines of education-related benefits could be exploited in a way that will blur the lines between college sports and professional leagues. ""Whatever their labels, these new allowances are akin to professional salaries,"" said Seth Waxman, the NCAA's lead attorney, during his opening arguments Wednesday. Waxman and the NCAA claim that the unpaid status of college athletes is a key part of their appeal to consumers. Waxman says that because amateurism is the characteristic that sets the NCAA apart from others in the marketplace of sports entertainment, the organization should get to decide how to define the line between amateurs and professionals. He said that the ruling in district court amounted to a judge micromanaging the NCAA's business. Plaintiff's attorney Jeffrey Kessler and several of the justices pushed back on the idea that providing athletes with money would cause the public to lose interest in college sports. ""The courts are appropriately focused on that, but we believe nothing bad will happen,"" Kessler told ESPN on Wednesday afternoon. ""Just like nothing bad happened after the O'Bannon case they lost. Nothing bad happened after the Board of Regents case they lost. Nothing bad happened after the NCAA v. Law case that they lost. They always warn, the NCAA, that this will be the thing that ruins college sports. And what we find instead is that when they're forced to comply with the law it actually helps college sports."" Justice Samuel Alito pointed out that athletes already receive some payment in the form of scholarships, stipends and other benefits and that those allowances have not caused a downturn in TV ratings or ticket sales. Waxman said the NCAA defines payment as any compensation that goes beyond ""reasonable and necessary expenses to obtain an education."" Justice Amy Coney Barrett later questioned why the NCAA should get to decide how to define what it means for an athlete to be paid. Several justices also expressed skepticism about the NCAA's ""high-minded"" claims about the importance of preserving amateurism. Justice Elena Kagan asked why the court shouldn't see the NCAA as an organization that has undisputed power over its market and uses the idea of amateurism to fix the price of labor. Kagan said that while amateurism may have been created more than a century ago to protect an institution that provides social value, that doesn't mean that is its function today. ""You can only ride on the history for so long. A great deal has changed since 100 years ago in the way student-athletes are treated,"" Kagan said. ""A great deal has changed [since 1985], let alone 100 years ago. I guess it doesn't move me all that much that there is a history to this."" Later, when questioning the plaintiff's case, Kagan asked whether the incremental increase in what athletes are allowed to make will lead to more litigation in the future. She echoed the concern of several justices that their ruling in the Alston case would be the first step in a series of lawsuits that steadily chip away at the NCAA's rules until college sports are clearly professional by anyone's definition. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wondered what the ""end game"" would be for the plaintiffs to feel fully satisfied in the future. Kagan referred to it as the ""floodgates argument."" ""What's next?"" she asked. ""Is it going to go up and up and up and pretty soon it will just be a regular labor market?"" Justice Stephen Breyer was the most adamantly opposed of his colleagues to treating college sports like other industries. ""I think if we really have a case here, it's a tough case for me,"" Breyer said. ""This is not an ordinary product. This is an effort to bring into the world something that has brought joy and all kinds of things to millions and millions of people, and it's only partly economic. OK, so, I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run."" Breyer argued that even if consumer demand wasn't significantly harmed by providing more compensation to athletes, there were other implications to changing the NCAA's rules that were worth considering. He cited the administrative burden on colleges and universities to implement these new rules as one example. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who spoke at the hearing in support of the plaintiff's side, said that the antitrust issue in front of the court was the only argument for it to consider. She said it was up to Congress and state legislators, not the judicial branch, to decide whether other problems that might come from changing the NCAA rules are worth the government's intervention. Prelogar petitioned to speak at the hearing in a somewhat unusual move in order to share the Department of Justice's thoughts on amateurism rules and how they fit into antitrust law. She said that amateurism was relevant in the case only to the extent that it impacts the NCAA's business model. She urged the justices to affirm the lower court's decision, saying that ""there is no pro-competitive justification to deprive athletes to get benefits through ordinary competition."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wr-jamarr-chase-wouldnt-mind-reunion-cincinnati-bengals/story?id=76795081,sports,WR Ja'Marr Chase 'wouldn't mind' reunion with Cincinnati Bengals QB Joe Burrow,"Wide receiver           , who opted out of his final season at           before turning pro, says he is open to a reunion with his former teammate and quarterback           in          . ""I wouldn't mind going back with Joe,"" Chase said Wednesday. ""If we go back together, we're trying to do nothing but get back our chemistry and have some more fun."" Cincinnati, which selected Burrow No. 1 overall last year, owns the fifth pick in this year's           and Chase said he has spoken with the Bengals during the pre-draft process. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. lists Chase as the No. 2 wide receiver in the draft, behind          's          , and the No. 4 overall prospect. In January, Burrow was asked about Chase and the possibility of getting back together. He too said he ""wouldn't mind"" reconnecting. ""That's a really good player. It's pretty easy to throw to him when he has 5 yards of separation every snap,"" Burrow said. ""He's an exciting player and a great guy and a friend as well. He was fun to play with."" With Burrow as his quarterback, Chase had 84 catches for 1,780 yards and 20 touchdowns in 2019 and won the Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation's top receiver. Chase told the SEC Network that he would let his results and film from his superb 2019 season speak for him when asked to make his pitch as the top wide receiver in this year's draft class. ""It's very important for me [to be the first receiver picked], not just because I dreamed of it, but I worked my butt off to get here,"" Chase said. ""I don't want nobody to take that from me. I'm not letting anyone take it from me. So I'm gonna keep working."" Chase joined a number of his former LSU teammates and ran an unofficial 4.38-second 40-yard dash during the Tigers' pro day on Wednesday. He also posted an 11-foot standing broad jump and a 41-inch vertical jump. ""I would say I kind of surprised myself,"" Chase said of his 40 time. ""I was going for a low 4.4, but last night I was feeling good about my starts and felt like I could get a 4.3 this morning. And I did it."" Chase wasn't the only potential first-round receiver to take part in the pro day.          , whom Kiper rates as the sixth-best receiver in the draft, ran an unofficial 4.38-second 40-yard dash as well. Marshall appeared in seven games, catching 48 passes for 731 yards and 10 touchdowns, before opting out last season."
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/ncaa-president-mark-emmert-admits-inequality-womens-basketball/story?id=76791226,sports,NCAA president Mark Emmert admits inequality but wants women's basketball leaders to push progress,"NCAA president Mark Emmert on Wednesday continued to apologize for the inequities between the men's and women's basketball tournaments that were exposed earlier this month, conceding, ""we let them down,"" but he added that the women's basketball community has to determine specific improvements it wants to ""pick up and run with"" as the sport moves forward. A recent point of debate has been branding differences, as the March Madness slogan isn't used in conjunction with the women's tournament and the Final Fours are differentiated by the use of ""Women's"" preceding the Final Four logo. While Emmert said he is committed to ""making sure that we use the marks of the NCAA as effectively as we can in promoting women's basketball,"" he added that ""those are debates for marketing people and those who want to promote the game."" ""There's no reason at all why those two logos can't be whatever the women's side wants,"" Emmert said. ""The women's staff are a part of the NCAA. They're part of my national office. We all work and live in the same building. This is not somebody against the NCAA. It's part of the NCAA. The March Madness logo can -- if the women's committee and the women's community wants it used -- there's no reason they can't use it. ""Similarly, 'Final Four' is used by both, and whether or not one wants to use the logo with a gender identifier is up to the committee, and they can certainly do whatever they'd like to do with those things. So, yes, I'm fully committed to doing that."" Emmert addressed the media for about 30 minutes Wednesday ahead of the          . While he spoke about a variety of topics, the focus continued to be on gender-equity issues, which were again pushed to the forefront after images surfaced on social media showing stark differences between the men's and women's weight rooms, their meals and the so-called ""swag bags."" Most of those issues have been resolved, but the bigger-picture topics -- which have been bubbling within the women's game for decades -- have prompted the NCAA to hire a New York-based law firm to conduct an external review into gender equity for all of the NCAA-sponsored championships. ""When you lay the men's and women's championships side by side, as has been made clear over the past weeks, it is pretty self-evident that we dropped the ball in supporting our women's athletes, and we can't do that,"" Emmert said. ""That's a failure that should not exist."" Emmert said the NCAA needs to use what happened in San Antonio ""as a pivot point, an inflection point to say: What do we need to do better? How do we make up for those shortcomings from this day going on and create the kind of gender equity that we all talk about ... to make sure it's a reality, not just language?"" The NCAA has to make sure its 90 championships -- 45 of which are women's events -- are ""the pinnacle, the exemplar of how we treat men and women in those championships,"" Emmert said. ""That is not what we did here,"" he said. ""We are -- I am -- sorry for that. That is something that we should never have allowed to happen. I get that. So does everyone now."" Asked why it has taken so long to address many of the same issues that were raised in a 2013 report prepared for the NCAA by current Big East commissioner Val Ackerman, Emmert pointed to another NCAA study done about two years ago but ultimately said ""there's no excuse."" ""Those have been and continue to be really heavily discussed,"" Emmert said. ""I think they've led to positive changes around women's basketball, but clearly too little has been done and not enough has been executed on them. The women's basketball community first and foremost also has to determine which parts of those recommendations, like in Val's or anybody else's white paper, that they want to pick up and run with. ""There's no excuse other than we need to do better and we need to get the commitment of all of our governance structure to get on with it. That's what we're doing now. That's why we're doing our review, and that's why I want to work with the coaches' association and others to resolve those problems."" The Women's Basketball Coaches Association on Tuesday sent a letter to Emmert saying that the NCAA's external review was ""insufficient to meet the needs of the WBCA's member coaches."" In the letter, which was obtained by ESPN, the WBCA instead asked for an independent ""commission on gender inequity in college sports"" to be led by individuals chosen by the WBCA and NCAA. ""WBCA is a critical partner,"" Emmert said. ""They're the experts on women's basketball. They have more knowledge and understanding of the game and what's been going on for a long time than anybody else. They have to be an essential part of understanding all of this."" Emmert, NCAA vice president for basketball Dan Gavitt and vice president for women's basketball Lynn Holzman were on a Zoom call with WBCA members shortly after Emmert spoke with the media, with          's Dawn Staley,          's Cori Close,          's Nell Fortner,          's Geno Auriemma and former           coach Muffet McGraw asking questions about what happened with the inequities with this year's tournament and with the sport in general. Asked by Close about the size of the main staffs who work on the championships, Gavitt said it was 12 for the men and six for the women. He said in retrospect that he didn't give enough weight to the fact that the men are used to a tournament in which the NCAA manages neutral-site venues for all rounds, whereas the women normally rely on the 16 host schools to manage the early rounds. With the coronavirus pandemic forcing the entire women's tournament to the San Antonio area, there was more for the NCAA to manage this year. ""I wish I'd realized earlier on that Lynn needed a lot more bodies to pull this off,"" Gavitt said, while acknowledging that Holzman had requested additional staff. ""This is a very different format for both championships, but even more for the women's championship."" Fortner, who noted the women's tournament's growth over the years, questioned why the signage, logos and courts for the women's tournament didn't use the ""March Madness"" moniker or tap into the ways the men's tournament is branded as an iconic sports event. Holzman said they didn't have special courts at early-round women's sites at Texas, Texas State, UTSA and Saint Mary's because such courts weren't previously produced or prioritized. The coaches pointed out that it made those games appear on television to be average games rather than NCAA tournament games. ""I do believe that there needs to be this bigger branding strategy discussion,"" Holzman said. ""There clearly the last few years have been some other conversations that we need to be having together, from the outset, with men's basketball about what is right for the game of basketball in college. I expect we're going to see some pretty substantive changes here in order to elevate the championship where it needs to be at."" Asked in the media session whether there was anything he wishes he would have done differently in his response to the tournament differences, Emmert replied, ""There always is. ""Those things just shouldn't happen. We could have and should have avoided them, and we didn't. That's a miss on my part. That's a miss on everybody's part. We were really focused on making sure we could get through this during the pandemic, and we weren't as focused on the kind of equity that we needed. The thing I'm most regretful for is that we didn't catch it up front. ""To have this incredible event marred by these incidences is just wrenching. Anything we could have done to avoid that I would have happily done and obviously wish we had. These athletes deserve that. They've earned it, they deserve it. We let them down, and that shouldn't have occurred."""

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/nfl-owners-approve-daniel-snyders-buyout-washington-football/story?id=76797748,sports,"NFL owners approve Daniel Snyder's buyout of Washington Football Team minority owners, source says"," owner Daniel Snyder's family has gained complete control of the franchise for the first time since buying it more than two decades ago. NFL owners unanimously approved Snyder's purchase of the remaining 40.5% of the Washington Football Team from the franchise's minority owners, a source told ESPN. The NFL also approved a $450 million debt waiver as well as the $875 million sale. Snyder bought out his three longtime minority investors, Fred Smith, Dwight Schar and Robert Rothman, who have been with Snyder since 2003. Before the purchase, Snyder had owned 40.459% of the team, with his mother, Arlette, owning 6.5% and his sister, Michele, owning 12.55%. Now the family owns 100% of the franchise, which Snyder bought in 1999. Snyder would have to repay the debt by 2028. The Washington Post reported in November that a group of investors had offered the minority shareholders $900 million to sell but that Snyder blocked the move. The battle among the minority owners and Snyder spilled into the public eye this summer and continued into the winter, with numerous court filings as the sides accused each other of bad-faith dealings and spreading misinformation. According to ESPN's Seth Wickersham, the sale will end the dispute between Snyder and his former co-owners. Washington also is in the middle of a rebrand, having decided to retire its previous name last summer. It hasn't yet settled on a new name or logo, but there will be a permanent one in place for the 2022 season. It will continue as the Washington Football Team this season. The organization set out to improve its culture shortly after the Post's articles. Among other moves, it hired Jason Wright as the NFL's first Black team president and Julie Donaldson as the senior vice president of media and the first woman to be part of an NFL team's radio broadcast. Washington also remains under an independent investigation by attorney Beth Wilkinson, stemming from a number of sexual harassment allegations by previous employees over a 15-year period. The investigation remains ongoing. On a videoconference call,           owner John Mara was asked whether the vote signaled confidence that Snyder would be found of no wrongdoing in the investigation. Mara declined comment on that aspect, saying he's not involved at all in the investigation, but said, ""I'm just glad it was settled between Dan and the minority partners so they can move ahead."""

""We are following MLB protocols and CDC protocols and working closely with the league to determine our next steps,"" Rizzo said. ""It will be a lot of balls in the air until then."" The positive result came from a test conducted Monday while the Nationals were still in Florida for spring training. Word of the test result came a little after 1 a.m. Wednesday, after the team had traveled home to Washington, where it is scheduled to host the           on Thursday night for Opening Day. The flight home was where there was close contact between the player who tested positive and the four teammates and staff member who are now quarantining. All six individuals will miss Thursday's opener, but their status after that is unclear. Per MLB's health and safety protocols for 2021, the player who tested positive will be required to isolate for a minimum of 10 days, receive appropriate care and monitoring from the club medical staff, and be cleared by baseball's joint COVID-19 committee and the individual's team physician following a mandatory cardiac evaluation and a determination that the individual no longer presents a risk of infection to others. Rizzo did not identify any of the six members of the organization who are involved. ""We'll have some roster decisions to make depending on how this all shakes out before Opening Day,"" Rizzo said. ""This is just a small blip on our radar screen. We're going to handle it and take it in stride."" The Nationals -- who had planned to have a workout at their stadium on Wednesday before it was called off because of rain -- did not have a single player test positive during their six weeks of spring training camp in West Palm Beach, Florida. The team has not yet been vaccinated. Rizzo said he has received one shot of the vaccine and will advise players to get it as soon as they are eligible but will leave the decision up to them. Thursday's starting pitcher,          , was not on the team flight and traveled separately with his family. He said having dealt with the pandemic last season has the team more prepared for events like what happened Wednesday. ""There's less unknowns,"" Scherzer told MLB on ESPN Radio. ""... 2020 was a good learning experience for all of us in knowing that, 'Hey, once it starts going, you kind of know how this ends.' Now we have that information; it's not, I would say, last year when you started hearing a lot more positive tests going around that you just felt like it was way more widespread. Hopefully this one is contained as well as we can because of all of the protocols we have in place now. You know everything that we do, hopefully we contained it and hopefully it's not a big deal."" Rizzo said the team underwent a new round of COVID-19 tests Wednesday, as was previously scheduled -- a combination of rapid tests and MLB-mandated saliva tests. He noted that there are players available to be brought in from the club's alternate training site in Fredericksburg, Virginia. ""This is the reason you have 60 good players in the organization, to kind of prepare for these type of ... scenarios,'' he said."
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/york-giants-owner-john-mara-spending-big-money/story?id=76799377,sports,"New York Giants co-owner John Mara says after spending big money, 'time for us to start winning'"," co-owner John Mara approved of the team spending more money this offseason as it handed out more than $100 million in guaranteed money. But without saying general manager Dave Gettleman's job is in jeopardy, Mara also made it clear what he expects in return. ""It's time for us to start winning,"" Mara told reporters via videoconference after the conclusion of the NFL owners meetings Wednesday. ""That's one of the reasons we spent the money we did."" To that end, Mara and the Giants re-signed defensive lineman           and signed receiver           and cornerback           . All totaled, New York committed $110 million in guaranteed money to this trio. It represents a pivot for a team that had not spent big in free agency in recent years. But Mara said the Giants wanted to surround quarterback           with more talent. Mostly, though, he wants to do something they haven't done recently: win. The Giants have posted losing seasons in seven of the past eight years. After going 11-5 in 2016, New York has gone a combined 18-46. That ties them with the           for the NFL's worst record during this span. ""It's been a very difficult four- or five-year period for us,"" Mara said. ""I'm tired of the losing and having a postseason press conference trying to explain what went wrong and why I think we're making progress. ""I think we're moving in the right direction, but it's been brutal the last few years. We're looking forward to turning it around and not having to make excuses for why we haven't done it."" New York hopes Golladay, new tight end           ($12 million) and speedy receiver           ($2.5 million) can help invigorate the offense. The return of running back           should help, as well. But the additional help means Jones needs to produce. He threw 11 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions in 14 games last year. In two seasons, he has thrown a combined 35 touchdowns and 22 picks while the Giants are 8-18 with him as a starter. Mara said he wouldn't put any benchmarks on Jones to measure his improvement -- or to gauge his team's desire to keep him around. ""We think the world of Daniel,"" Mara said. ""We want to see him take the next step. I don't have any specific benchmarks other than, let's win some more games. He'll have a better team around him this year than he's had in previous years, so we certainly expect him to take that next step. I want to see him continue to improve because I do think he has what it takes to be a long-term winner in this league."" Mara pointed to coach Joe Judge as one reason he's optimistic. New York finished 6-10 in Judge's first year, a two-game improvement over 2019. But Mara said it's ""definitely"" a better locker room than it has been in a while and that players believe in Judge. ""We won only six games last year, but I sensed just a different feeling from the players. They believe in his message. You could see that in team meetings. You could see that on the practice field and you could see in their effort. Now is the time to start winning more games,"" he said. That's partly why Mara wasn't about to put Gettleman on the so-called hot seat in March, despite a 15-33 record since his hiring in 2018. ""I'm not going to speculate on that right now,"" Mara said. ""Let's see how the season plays out. I have more confidence going into this season than I've had in previous years. Hopefully the money that we spent and given the draft we expect to have, we'll have a better team on the field this year. Mara said the Giants didn't plan on spending so much money this offseason, but said the right opportunities presented themselves with Golladay and Jackson. He said he talked to Golladay before he signed, trying to sell him on doing so, but added by that time the receiver's mind was probably made up. It also mattered that Golladay, 27, and Jackson, 25, were both young and played positions of need. Williams is 26. ""You can't do that every year, but when the opportunity presents itself you have to seize it,"" Mara said. ""That's what we did this year. We think it will pay off. We're certainly not a finished product by any stretch of the imagination, but I do like the direction that we're going."" One thing the spending did prevent: an extension for Barkley, who is coming off a torn ACL. But he's entering his fourth season and New York can pick up his fifth-year option, so there's time for an extension to happen. Mara said he does want to get one done eventually. ""We fully expect him to be as good as new,"" Mara said. ""If anybody is going to spend 100% of his efforts to rehab it will be Saquon. But we're not in any hurry to do that particularly after the money we just spent. But I said it at the end of the season and I'll say it again: We hope he's going to be a Giant for life. At the appropriate time we'll start those discussions."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jj-redick-sounds-off-orleans-pelicans-front-offices/story?id=76795341,sports,JJ Redick sounds off on New Orleans Pelicans front office's handling of trade to Dallas Mavericks," criticized the          ' front office for the way it handled his trade to the           at last week's NBA trade deadline, saying executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin ""did not honor his word"" to help put Redick in a favorable situation where he would be closer to his family. Redick, who signed a two-year, $26.5 million deal with the Pelicans as a free agent in the summer of 2019, said on his ""The Old Man & the Three"" podcast, which was released Wednesday, that he first requested to be dealt last November for several reasons. One reason was a desire to be closer to his family in Brooklyn, where his son was starting kindergarten and would not be able to travel to New Orleans because of quarantine rules at the school. Another reason was the Pelicans trading away guard          , who Redick said was one of the main reasons he wanted to play in New Orleans in the first place. He expressed all of this to Griffin and general manager Trajan Langdon. Redick said that while his agent handled things, he also talked with Griffin personally. ""I talked to Griff. I talked to Trajan. Griff basically says to me, 'Come down for a month. If you still want to be traded, I give you my word, I'll get you to a situation that you like.' We had four subsequent conversations,"" Redick said on the podcast. ""Again, my agent talked to them. But I'm talking to Griff directly. Griff and I had a personal relationship. ""Obviously, he did not honor his word."" When asked specifically by podcast co-host Tommy Alter if he thinks players will be able to trust the Pelicans' front office moving forward, Redick was blunt. ""I don't think you're going to get honesty from that front office, just objectively speaking,"" Reddick said. ""That's not an opinion -- I just don't think you're going to get that. I don't think what happened with me is necessarily an isolated incident either. But I do think across the league, front offices, they act in their best interest. I get that. I understand that. ""Truthfully -- and it's hard for me to admit this -- I think I was a little naive in thinking that because I was in Year 15, and I had at least attempted to do things right throughout my career and I honored my end of the bargain ... But in terms of this front office, yeah, it's not something where I would expect certainly the agents that worked on this with me to ever trust that front office again."" Redick said it was his understanding that once he was not dealt at the aggregate deadline on Feb. 2, he would be bought out and allowed to go to a team of his choosing. Redick wanted to be dealt to a team in the Northeast, where he could be closer to his family in Brooklyn. ""I look at the buyout situation not as, 'Oh, I'm going to be bought out and go to [the] Brooklyn [Nets],'"" he said. ""I just wanted to be able to, on an off day, go see my family and be within driving distance."" Redick, 36, said he will join the Mavericks on Thursday when the team reaches New York City, as they are scheduled to play the           on Friday. He will continue to rehab from a heel procedure on his own in New York before rejoining the team at a later date. Redick said he made it clear in a conversation with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban that he wasn't upset with Dallas in any way, and said he's excited about playing with ""two transcendent young players"" in           and          . When asked about the Redick trade last week, Griffin, while saying he recognized the strain COVID-19 has placed on families, said the team spent the ""vast majority"" of the year trying to put Redick into a spot near his family. ""We did spend a great deal of time trying to put JJ closer to home,"" Griffin said Friday. ""When it became clear that the teams that were in the best position regionally for him were not necessarily the most aggressive in landing him, we did have conversations about the importance of immediately contending, as he's aging. ""I think we felt confident that JJ welcomed the better contending opportunity because we're not even at the play-in at this point. We felt it was the right thing to do for him and his family."" On Wednesday, shortly after Redick's comments went public, Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy addressed the media, saying a front office's responsibility is to the franchise first. ""[JJ] had some things that he wanted to happen. But I think Griff cared very much about what JJ wanted, but he has a responsibility to Gayle Benson and to the organization that supersedes all of that,"" Van Gundy said. ""Listen, the one thing with me -- and I think I've been consistent about this throughout my career -- is you'll hear people say it from time to time that it's a business; well, it is. Players are going to want to do what's best for them, and they have every damn right to do that, and organizations have every damn right to do what's best for their organization. I have problems when it gets skewed that it's a business from my end, but you should not be a business on your end. That's not right. It's a business on both ends of it. ""Everyone should do what's best for them. That part of it, the business part of basketball, when you're talking about trades and free-agent signings and contracts and all of that -- everyone should do what's best for their interest. Unfortunately, sometimes what the player wants and what the team wants diverge. That's unfortunate, but that's just part of the way it is."""

""In the end, if you want to have a good, consistent, winning football team, you can't do it in free agency. You have to do it through the draft. I don't feel we've done the greatest job the last few years and I really hope, and I believe, I've seen a different approach this year,"" Kraft said Wednesday in his annual Q&A with reporters during the NFL owners meeting.

Their top selection is 15th overall, which will be their highest pick since tabbing linebacker Jerod Mayo 10th overall in 2008. Their free-agent spending spree, which Kraft explained was strategic in terms of how quickly the team moved with limited competition from other teams due to the declining salary cap, was necessary to fill some holes that would have ideally been filled by draft picks. ""What happened here last year was not something to our liking. We had to make the corrections,"" Kraft said. ""In all the businesses we're involved in, we try to take advantage of inefficiencies in the market. We were in a unique cap situation this year and it allowed us to try to [fix] things we missed, to a certain extent, in the draft. So this was our best opportunity. ""In the end, it all comes out to what happens on the field and how well people execute. You really don't know how good a draft is for at least two years, especially in the environment we're in now ... I'm not quite sure still now what our offseason training and learning abilities will be. I think last year, younger players were really disadvantaged because they didn't have the time to learn."" Kraft said that also applied, in part, to quarterback           after he joined the Patriots in early July without the benefit of an offseason. So while Kraft said that the team still needs to solidify the quarterback position, he's not ruling out Newton being the answer in 2021 and possibly beyond. ""In fairness to Cam, I'm not sure he had the proper weapons around him last year,"" Kraft said, noting Newton's strong start in 2020 before his momentum was stunted after testing positive for COVID-19 in early October. ""I really do believe Cam getting COVID, and what it did to the team, it changed a lot. Now we'll get a chance to see. ""Players on the team, in the locker room, really love the guy. In the end, I trust Coach Belichick's ability to build a team, and put the right players in the best position to succeed."" At the same time, Kraft noted that 2019 fourth-round pick            is still a possibility to emerge, praising his initiative to arrange throwing sessions last week with teammates in Southern California. ""I don't know that Jarrett has ever really gotten a fair shot,"" Kraft said. ""We have to wait and see what happens, and we still have the draft. ... Quarterback is the most important position on the team. One way or the other, we have to get that position solidified."" The Patriots haven't been in this position for decades, as           (2001 to 2020) had taken over for Drew Bledsoe (1993 to 2001) before signing with the           in free agency in March of 2020. Kraft said the Patriots gave Brady the ability to depart by forgoing the opportunity to assign him the franchise tag, and he has no regrets doing so. ""After 20 years, I'll make this commitment to any player in the future. Anyone who spends 20 years with us, and helps us go to win six Super Bowls, we're not going to keep; look, we could have contract-wise, kept him in our camp. But it's not the right thing,"" he said. This was the first time Kraft answered questions from reporters since the end of the season.

Biden made his comments as part of an interview with ESPN's Sage Steele that aired on SportsCenter. The Rangers' Globe Life Field, which can seat 40,300 people, is the only Major League Baseball stadium that will allow 100% crowd capacity on its Opening Day. ""Well, that's a decision they made. I think it's a mistake,"" Biden said. ""They should listen to Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, the scientists and the experts. But I think it's not responsible."" Fans attending Rangers games will be required to wear masks except when eating or drinking at their seats. After the April 5 home opener against the          , certain parts of Globe Life Field will have ""distanced seating"" sections that will have more space between occupied seats, according to the Rangers. When asked how he would advise players who might feel hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, Biden said: ""I would say I'm President of the United States and I got vaccinated. I don't have an unimportant job. Would I take the vaccine if I thought it was going to hurt me? We have done incredible research on the vaccines and they have shown that they work. We have to get to the point where enough people have taken the vaccine so we diminish the possibility for it to spread."" As a way to potentially incentivize MLB players to receive one of three approved vaccines, Major League Baseball           that outlined relaxed protocols for vaccinated players, coaches and staff members, allowing them the freedom to eat at restaurants, gather indoors and fully utilize clubhouse amenities, among other activities. The league has specified two sets of relaxed protocols: one for individuals two weeks removed from being fully vaccinated; and the other for teams that get 85% of their Tier 1 employees fully vaccinated. People throughout the industry have previously expressed concern that enough players would agree to vaccinations for relaxed protocols to kick in. But           manager Mike Shildt said Wednesday that his team had already reached that mark, and           third baseman           expressed confidence that his team would eventually do the same. Other clubs are expected to follow. The          , however, announced they received a positive COVID-19 test from an undisclosed player and that four other players would miss Thursday's opener against the visiting            under the contact-tracing protocol. The Nationals will open their stadium to 5,000 fans on Thursday, a 12% capacity that is tied with the           for the lowest in the sport. Several teams hope to join the Rangers on the 100% milestone over the summer. The NFL, meanwhile, is already making plans to host fans at full capacity when its season opens on Sept. 9,          . Biden noted that more than 600 million doses of the three vaccines -- Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna -- have been purchased by the U.S. government and that 75% of people age 65 and older have received at least one of them. ""We are moving across the board that way,"" Biden said. ""That's going to diminish the prospects of its spread. In terms of it being responsible [for stadiums to open at full capacity] -- you see what's happening in Europe now when they lifted the mandates. I don't know why we don't just follow the science and beat this -- just flat out beat it. We are going to have enough vaccinations, vaccinators. We've opened places. We're doing everything we can to make it clear to people, 'Get the vaccine as quickly as you can get it.' By the end of [April], we're going to be in a position where everyone can get the vaccine."" As MLB and the MLB Players Association grapple with player vaccinations and how they affect the ever-evolving health and safety protocols, the league and the union are also monitoring a potential controversy around July's All-Star Game in Atlanta. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law last week a sweeping, Republican-sponsored bill that includes new restrictions on voting by mail and greater legislative control over how elections are run, one that, critics say, will disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color. MLBPA executive director Tony Clark previously said he ""would look forward"" to discussions around moving the Midsummer Classic out of Truist Park, and Biden, a Democrat, said he would ""strongly support"" such a decision. ""People look to them,"" Biden said, referring to professional athletes and their outsize platforms. ""They're leaders. Look at what happened with the NBA, as well. Look what's happened across the board. The very people who were victimized the most are the people who are the leaders in these various sports, and it's just not right. This is Jim Crow on steroids what they're doing in Georgia and 40 other states. What's it all about? Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Can't do that? Come on. Or you're going to close the polling place at 5 o'clock when people just get off? This is all about keeping working folks that I grew up with from being able to vote."" Biden described his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, as a die-hard fan of Philadelphia sports teams and said the best athletes in his family are women, noting that one of his granddaughters is all-state in two sports. Biden and his wife hosted Olympic gold medalist Megan Rapinoe and her U.S. women's soccer teammate Margaret Purce in the Oval Office last Wednesday, then watched Rapinoe speak at an ""Equal Pay Day"" event in which she said she has been ""devalued"" as a woman. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that in 2019, women earned 82 cents for each dollar paid to a man. ""I just don't think it's right and don't think it's fair,"" Biden told Steele. ""That's why I supported Title IX."""

Pitts put on a show, even before he stepped on the field to catch passes from quarterback           for maybe the last time. His 83⅜-inch wingspan was more than impressive, even by NFL standards. The 6-foot-6 and 245-pound Philadelphia native also had a 33½-inch vertical, recorded 10 feet, 9 inches in the broad jump and managed 22 repetitions of 225 pounds on the bench press. Pitts later covered the 40-yard dash in 4.45 seconds, not far off tight end Vernon Davis' combine watershed mark (4.38) set in 2006. He ended the day running routes for Trask and then raised some eyebrows while sharing his No. 1 goal. ""Start at a high level and keep increasing every year and being able to do other things that other tight ends aren't doing, which would make me special,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, with all the preparation and through the years, I feel like I'll be the best to ever do it."" Pitts, Trask and several teammates -- most notably cornerback           and receivers           and           -- worked out for talent evaluators from 31 of 32 NFL teams. Four head coaches were in attendance: Urban Meyer (          ), Matt Rhule (          ), Brian Flores (          ) and Zac Taylor (          ). Pitts is widely considered a lock to be a top-10 pick in the draft, and it's possible for Pitts to be the highest-drafted tight end in the modern era (since 1970). Denver drafted Riley Odoms fifth overall in 1972. Davis and Kellen Winslow Jr. (2004) both went sixth. ""He's a different bird than what a traditional tight end has been or certainly has been when I played,"" said           coach Dan Campbell, a tight end who played 11 NFL seasons. ""Look, he's one of those guys that's talented, but there's a number of guys up there that are talented. ... There's a number of guys that you'd be fired up to have one way or another."" The Lions have the tight end most recently drafted in the top 10,           in 2018. Hockenson is among a growing list of recent first-rounders at the position --          ,          ,          ,          ,           and           are others -- whose careers, at least at times, have fallen short of expectations. Pitts caught 43 passes for 770 yards and 12 touchdowns in 7½ games last season. He missed 10 quarters following a vicious hit against Georgia in early November that knocked his helmet so sideways that his face mask fractured his septum. He had surgery and sat out two full games. He returned, scored three times against Kentucky and then opted out of the Cotton Bowl after another unstoppable performance against Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game."

On Monday, the visiting Flyers overcame a 3-0 deficit to beat Buffalo in the shootout. But it was a different story on Wednesday night, as Sabres defenseman           scored two short-handed goals on the same third-period penalty kill, 37 seconds apart, to clinch the win. ""Tonight was a full 60 minutes where everyone was moving and feeling good,"" Montour said. ""It was a tough stretch. You never want to lose. The streak we had, everyone was talking about it. Everyone had something to say. But the guys have been positive through the tough time we've been dealing with here."" Sabres interim coach Don Granato, who earned his first NHL victory (1-5-1), decided not to say anything to the players between the second and third periods on Wednesday night, instead allowing the Sabres to motivate themselves. ""I handed it off to the guys. We felt it was best to hand it to them. 'It's your third period. Not ours. You know what to do.' And we felt they did know what they do,"" Granato said. ""They absolutely got the job done under heavy pressure. They pulled together, instead of apart.""  made 31 saves in goal for Buffalo. The Sabres had gone 0-15-3 since Feb. 25. They own the record for the longest winless streak of the shootout era (since 2005-06) and have tied the 2003-04           for the most consecutive losses -- including overtime and shootout losses -- in the 21st century. The Sabres were the 18th team in NHL history to go winless over an 18-game span. ""I don't get too high or low on wins. You have to enjoy it for a few minutes and move on to the next one,"" Granato said, ""but I was extremely happy for our guys."" Buffalo is 7-23-5 (.271 points percentage) on the season, last in the NHL."

""That's how serious it was for us. I can't speak for everybody, but I know that guys were trying to text family just in case, you know? It was that kind of situation.""

During his pregame media availability, Utah coach Quin Snyder declined to answer a question about whether Tuesday's frightening incident could impact Mitchell's availability for future road games. The Jazz, who have a home back-to-back this weekend, are next scheduled to play on the road Monday in Dallas. Snyder said the Jazz met Wednesday morning in Memphis to help one another process the terrifying experience. ""I don't know that an experience like that is just suddenly passed on and away,"" Snyder said. ""Everybody's impacted in different ways, all very significant. And it wasn't something that we were going to solve by just talking through everything, but I think it was important to acknowledge what we all went through [Tuesday], and, really, that same feeling of gratitude and appreciation for the fragility that we all live with, sometimes without being aware of it."" Conley said it felt like there was an explosion on the plane, a Delta charter. He said the plane immediately started to bounce and tilt left, and people in the back saw flames as altitude dropped on the flight. ""Nobody knows. Everybody's just quiet,"" said Conley, who had 26 points and seven assists in the win over the Grizzlies. ""It took the pilots probably five to 10 minutes, probably about 10 minutes, to go through everything, go through their checks and get back to us and let us know what was going on. Because it was obvious that something was really wrong with the plane. ""It felt like the plane was breaking apart in midair. For five or 10 minutes, it felt like complete helplessness. We're thankful it wasn't as serious as it could have been, but it was scary."" Snyder, Clarkson and Conley each praised the pilots for their calm, professionalism and expertise in executing the emergency landing. ""It's definitely something, an experience, that we're happy to be able to tell,"" Clarkson said. ""A lot of us really came to a point ... at least 30 seconds in that flight, everybody came to the point where it was like, 'Man, it might be over for us.' It's sad to say that. I don't play with death or anything like that. ""It's just something that we've got to push through and come together and keep going, stay strong, support each other.

""They absolutely got the job done under heavy pressure. They pulled together, instead of apart.""  made 31 saves in goal for Buffalo. The Sabres had gone 0-15-3 since Feb. 25. They own the record for the longest winless streak of the shootout era (since 2005-06) and tied the 2003-04           for the most consecutive losses -- including overtime and shootout defeats -- in the 21st century. The Sabres were the 18th team in NHL history to go winless over an 18-game span. ""I don't get too high or low on wins. You have to enjoy it for a few minutes and move on to the next one,"" Granato said, ""but I was extremely happy for our guys."" Buffalo is 7-23-5 (.271 points percentage) on the season, last in the NHL."

Literally. The newly acquired Lakers center exited Wednesday's           to the           with a bruised right big toe in the third quarter and did not return. X-rays on Drummond's toe came back negative, according to the team. Vogel said Drummond would be reevaluated Thursday and his status is day to day. The Lakers play next on Friday on the road against the           . ""I didn't really think anything of it,"" Drummond said. ""I came back in the second quarter and it was hurting a little bit more. And then after halftime, I finally took my sock off to look and my whole toenail was gone. So, it was just all bad from there. I couldn't walk or run. So I just told Coach [Frank Vogel] to take me out."" It was Drummond's first game action since Feb. 12, after which his former team, the          , pulled him from the rotation while searching for a trade partner to take on the nine-year veteran's $29.5 million salary. Drummond was waived last week when the Cavs couldn't find a deal to their liking, and he signed with the Lakers on Sunday. Despite the lengthy layoff, Drummond said, ""right now, I'm probably in the best shape I can be in"" earlier this week when looking ahead to suiting up for the Lakers for the first time. Drummond started the game in a pair of Air Jordan XI IE sneakers and swapped them out for a pair of LeBron 16 Lows. He received treatment at halftime, delaying his readiness for the third quarter, leaving Vogel no choice but to start           at center for the second half. Drummond subbed in for Harrell with 9 minutes, 29 seconds remaining in the third quarter, and then checked out of the game for good with 7:55 on the clock, limping to the bench. Before heading to the locker room, Drummond removed one of his sneakers, revealing a wrap around the big toe and second toe on his right foot. ""What do you do for a toe? I don't know,"" said Drummond, who wore sandals during his postgame interview. ""I'm not really sure what to do. I'm just going to talk to the training staff and find out what's the best thing to do to get back as quick as possible."" Lakers forward           said he has lost a toenail before and that it was an ordeal to overcome. ""I mean I played the next game, but s---, man, that s--- was like a month and a half before it started feeling better,"" Morris said. ""Because you don't realize how much your toe is rubbing against the top of your shoes, or you're using your toe for power. ... It's a terrible thing."" Said Drummond: ""I've lost a toenail before. But this one was very painful."" Drummond finished with four points on 2-for-6 shooting (0-for-2 on free throws), one rebound, two assists, one block, three turnovers and four fouls in 14 minutes. It was not the debut he and the Lakers were hoping for, however, there was a flash of success in his initial shift as a Laker. L.A. outscored Milwaukee by seven points in the seven minutes Drummond played in the first quarter. ""In that first quarter, a lot of energy from our guys and myself,"" he said. ""We were having a lot of fun out there. Just unfortunate for that to happen in the first game."" , displaced from the starting lineup by Drummond, started the fourth quarter at center and contributed two points, three rebounds, two blocks, one assist and one steal in six minutes. While Gasol declined to speak to reporters afterward -- the third time he has declined since L.A. acquired Drummond -- several members of the team praised him for his professionalism. ""Obviously, it's not easy by any means. Give that man his credit,"" Lakers guard           said. ""We love what we do and we compete and we're ultra competitors, and that's never easy for anybody in that position. ""For him to step up like he did and make the plays that he made and to be there and supportive of us the whole time, I mean, I got nothing but respect for him."""

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/virgin-galactic-rolls-latest-generation-spaceship-76768132,business,Virgin Galactic rolls out latest generation of spaceship,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Virgin Galactic rolled out its newest spaceship Tuesday as the company looks to resume test flights in the coming months at its headquarters in the New Mexico desert. Company officials said it will likely be summer before the ship — designed and manufactured in California — undergoes glide flight testing at Spaceport America in southern New Mexico. That will coincide with the final round of testing for the current generation of spacecraft, which will be the one that takes British billionaire and Virgin Galactic founder Sir Richard Branson to the fringes of space later this year. CEO Michael Colglazier said the addition of the new ship marks the beginning of Virgin Galactic having a fleet that will one day be capable of ferrying paying customers and scientific payloads from spaceports around the globe. The company is still aiming for commercial operations to begin next year following testing and a few months of downtime for maintenance and other upgrades. Virgin Galactic has reached space twice before — the first time from California in December 2018. The company marked its second successful glide flight over Spaceport America last June. Virgin Galactic is one of a few companies looking to cash in on customers with an interest in space. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin launched a new capsule in January as part of test as it aims to get its program for tourists, scientists and professional astronauts off the ground. The mirror-like finish on Virgin Galactic's new ship is as much about aesthetics as it is about function. A key part of the ship's thermal protection system, Colglazier said it also was chosen so the craft could take on the look and feel of its surroundings — whether it's on Earth, in the sky or in space. The other task of the engineers was to create a new version that would be easier to manufacture and to maintain. “Obviously for us to take tens of thousands of people to space, we need a number of ships. But it really matters then how often can each of these ships fly,” Colglazier said. “We expect as we get going on this to see a much quicker turnaround time and that really will help us grow the business.” First, Virgin Galactic needs regulatory approval for the current generation and that means successful rocket-powered test flights. The first powered test from Spaceport America was scheduled for December but computer trouble caused by electromagnetic interference prevented the spaceship’s rocket from firing properly. Instead of soaring toward space, the ship and its two pilots were forced to make an immediate landing. The test was rescheduled for February but then scrapped as the team continued working on the interference issue. Colglazier said the flight now is scheduled for May. The delay didn't help stock prices. Colglazier said while it's important to put points on the board and meet market expectations, the company's focus is on safety at each step and the decades ahead. “I think this is moving as we want it to move. It is stepwise — that is what we want to do with human spaceflight,"" he said, “but you can also see the monument building. We’re excited for this unveiling today and we’re excited for May and we’re excited for the summer to come.”"

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/detectives-find-tiger-woods-crash-reveal-citing-privacy/story?id=76805560,sports,"Detectives find cause of Tiger Woods crash but won't reveal it, citing privacy concerns","LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County sheriff says detectives have determined what caused           to crash his SUV last month in Southern California but would not release details Wednesday, citing unspecified privacy concerns for the golf star. Sheriff Alex Villanueva told the Associated Press during a live social media event that ""a cause has been determined; the investigation has concluded,"" but claimed that investigators needed permission from Woods -- who previously named his yacht ""Privacy"" -- to release information about the crash. Later Wednesday evening the sheriff's department attempted to clarify its position, saying in a statement on Twitter that ""the release of accident reports is governed under California Vehicle Code Section 20012. When we are able, we intend to release the information learned during the traffic collision investigation involving Tiger Woods."" Woods suffered serious injuries in the Feb. 23 crash when he struck a raised median around 7 a.m. in Rolling Hills Estates, just outside Los Angeles. The Genesis SUV he was driving crossed through two oncoming lanes and uprooted a tree on a downhill stretch that police said is known for wrecks. Woods is in Florida recovering from multiple surgeries. Villanueva has been criticized for his comments about the crash, calling it ""purely an accident"" and saying there was no evidence of impairment. Woods told deputies he did not know how the crash occurred and didn't remember driving. He was unconscious when a witness first approached the mangled SUV. But a sheriff's deputy said the athlete later appeared to be in shock but was conscious and able to answer basic questions. That initial statement from the sheriff's deputy has been cited as a reason investigators did not seek a search warrant for Woods' blood samples, which could have been screened for drugs and alcohol. In 2017, Woods checked himself into a clinic for help in dealing with prescription medication after a DUI charge in Florida. Detectives, however, did obtain a search warrant for the data recorder, known as a black box, from the 2021 Genesis GV80 SUV. Villanueva would not say Wednesday what data had been found in the black box. ""We have reached out to Tiger Woods and his personnel,"" Villanueva said. ""There's some privacy issues on releasing information on the investigation, so we're going to ask them if they waive the privacy and then we will be able to do a full release on all the information regarding the accident."" California has rather restrictive public records laws when it comes to law enforcement agencies. By law, it can withhold copies of accident reports, although generally it releases basic information. The law the sheriff's department cited Wednesday holds that ""all required accident reports, and supplemental reports ... shall be for the confidential use of the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of the California Highway Patrol."" However, it also states that ""the Department of the California Highway Patrol or the law enforcement agency to whom the accident was reported shall disclose the entire contents of the reports, the names and addresses of persons involved or injured in, or witnesses to, an accident, the registration numbers and descriptions of vehicles involved, the date, time and location of an accident, all diagrams, statements of the drivers involved or occupants injured in the accident and the statements of all witnesses to any person who may have a proper interest"" in the accident. Because Woods was the only person injured in the accident, and Villanueva has previously stated he was not being charged with a crime, only parties whose property was damaged in the accident -- such as the owners of the car, the city or neighbors -- would be entitled to a copy of the full accident report. Woods' agent at Excel Sports, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately respond to an email. ""We have all the contents of the black box, we've got everything,"" Villanueva said. ""It's completed, signed, sealed and delivered. However, we can't release it without the permission of the people involved in the collision."" Greg Risling, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County district attorney, said in an email Wednesday that no felony or misdemeanor complaints against Woods had been filed through their office regarding the crash. Villanueva's statement about privacy issues did not make sense to Joseph Giacalone, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a retired New York City Police Department sergeant, who has criticized the sheriff's response to the Woods incident from the start. ""I don't think I've ever seen a department ever ask for permission like that,"" he said. ""What happens if his lawyers say 'no, you can't send it out now.' And then where does that leave us?"" Giacalone said it's unlikely that deputies would have sought the permission of non-celebrity victims in similar crashes to release information. If the sheriff's hesitancy stemmed from a potential medical episode behind the wheel, Giacalone said, authorities could simply say it was a medical emergency without giving additional details. ""I don't think they would have asked any family member of us if they can come out with it,"" he said. Woods is from the Los Angeles area and was back home to host his PGA tournament, the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, which ended two days before the crash. He was driving an SUV lent to him by the tournament. Woods, 45, has never gone an entire year without playing, dating back to his first PGA Tour event as a 16-year-old in high school.          "

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/student-loan-relief-extended-privately-held-loans-76776264,business,Student loan relief extended to some privately held loans,"The federal government’s pause on student loan payments is being extended to more than 1 million borrowers who have defaulted on student loans that are held by private lenders, the Education Department announced Tuesday. The action is meant to bring relief to the hardest-hit borrowers in a program that allowed private lenders to provide student loans that were backed by the federal government. The program ended in 2010 when the Education Department became the sole lender of federally subsidized student loans. President Joe Biden announced in January that federal student loan payments would remain suspended and interest rates would be set at 0% through at least Sept. 30, extending an action from the administration of former President  . But it applied only to those with debt held directly by the federal government, leaving out millions with private student loans. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on Monday extended the payment pause and 0% interest rate to 1.1 million borrowers who had defaulted on privately held loans. It includes more than 800,000 who were at risk of having their tax refunds seized to repay a defaulted loan. “Our goal is to enable these borrowers who are struggling in default to get the same protections previously made available to tens of millions of other borrowers to help weather the uncertainty of the pandemic,” Cardona said in a statement. The Education Department said it’s working to return tax refunds or wages that were seized over the last year to cover the defaulted loans. Borrowers can also request refunds for any voluntary payments they made during the past year. Any loans that went into default since March 13, 2020, will be returned to good standing. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chair of the House’s education committee, called it “a necessary step to putting money in the pockets of struggling Americans and their families.” Advocacy groups called the measure a good start but said it fails to help more than 5 million borrowers other borrowers in the same program, known as the Federal Family Education Loan Program. “This is not enough,” said Persis Yu, director of the National Consumer Law Center’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance project. “The millions of FFEL borrowers who have not yet defaulted but who may be struggling to make their student loan payments often at the expense of other vital necessities need relief.”"

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/lighting-fuse-amazon-vote-spark-union-pushes-76768728,business,'Lighting a fuse': Amazon vote may spark more union pushes,"What happens inside a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, could have major implications not just for the country's second-largest employer but the labor movement at large. Organizers are pushing for some 6,000   workers there to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union on the promise it will lead to better working conditions, better pay and more respect.   is pushing back, arguing that it already offers more than twice the minimum wage in Alabama and workers get such benefits as  , vision and dental insurance without paying union dues. The two sides are fully aware that it's not just the Bessemer warehouse on the line. Organizers hope what happens there will inspire thousands of workers nationwide — and not just at Amazon — to consider unionizing and revive a labor movement that has been waning for decades. “This is lighting a fuse, which I believe is going to spark an explosion of union organizing across the country, regardless of the results,” says RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum. The union push could spread to other parts of Amazon and threaten the company's profits, which soared 84% last year to $21 billion. At a time when many companies were cutting jobs, Amazon was one of the few still hiring, bringing on board 500,000 people last year alone to keep up with a surge of online orders. Bessemer workers finished casting their votes on Monday. The counting begins on Tuesday, which could take days or longer depending on how many votes are received and how much time it takes for each side to review. The process is being overseen by the National Labor Relations Board and a majority of the votes will decide the final outcome. What that outcome will be is anyone's guess. Appelbaum thinks workers who voted early likely rejected the union because Amazon’s messaging got to them first. He says momentum changed in March as organizers talked to more workers and heard from basketball players and high-profile elected officials, including         President Joe Biden. For Amazon, which employs more than 950,000 full- and part-time workers in the U.S. and nearly 1.3 million worldwide, a union could lead to higher wages that would eat into its profits. Higher wages would also mean higher costs to get packages to shoppers’ doorsteps, which may prompt Amazon to raise prices, says Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. In a statement, Amazon says it encouraged all its employees to vote and that “their voices will be heard in the days ahead.” Any push to unionize is considered a long shot, since labor laws tend to favor employers. Alabama itself is a “right-to-work” state, which allows workers in unionized shops to opt out of paying union dues even as they retain the benefits and job protection negotiated by the union. Kent Wong, the director of the UCLA Labor Center, says companies in the past have closed stores, warehouses or plants after workers have voted to unionize. “There’s a history of companies going to great lengths to avoid recognizing the union,” he says. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, has successfully fought off organizing efforts over the years. In 2000, it got rid of butchers in 180 of its stores after they voted to form a union. Walmart said it cut the jobs because people preferred pre-packaged meat. Five years later, it closed a store in Canada where some 200 workers were close to winning a union contract. At the time, Walmart said demands from union negotiators made it impossible for the store to sustain itself. The only other time Amazon came up against a union vote was in 2014, when the majority of the 30 workers at a Delaware warehouse turned it down. This time around, Amazon has been hanging anti-union signs throughout the Bessemer warehouse, including inside bathroom stalls, and holding mandatory meetings to convince workers why the union is a bad idea, according to one worker who recently         testified at a Senate hearing. It has also created a website for employees that tells them they’ll have to pay $500 in union dues a month, taking away money that could go to dinners and school supplies. Amazon's hardball tactics extend beyond squashing union efforts. Last year, it         fired a worker who organized a walkout at a New York warehouse to demand greater protection against coronavirus, saying the employee himself flouted distancing rules. When Seattle, the home of its headquarters, passed a new tax on big companies in 2018, Amazon protested by         stopping construction of a new high-rise building in the city; the tax was repealed four weeks later. And in 2019, Amazon         ditched plans to build a $2.5 billion headquarters for 25,000 workers in New York after pushback from progressive politicians and unions. Beyond Amazon is an         anti-union culture that dominates the South. And unions have lost ground nationally for decades since their peak in the decades following World War II. In 1970, almost a third of the U.S. workforce belonged to a union. In 2020, that figure was 10.8%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Private sector workers now account for less than half of the 14.3 million union members across the country. Advocates say a victory would signal a shift in the narrative about unions, helping refute the typical arguments from companies, including Amazon, that workers can win adequate compensation and conditions by dealing with management directly. “It is because of unions that we have a five-day work week. It is because of unions that we have safer conditions in our places of work. It is because of unions that we have benefits,” says Rep. Terri Sewell, whose congressional district includes the Amazon facility. “Workers should have the right to choose whether they organize or not.” Union leaders are circumspect about specific organizing plans after the Bessemer vote, and Appelbaum says he doesn't want to tip off Amazon to any future efforts. But there is broad consensus that a win would spur workers at some of the 230 other Amazon warehouses to mount a similar union campaign. It’s less clear whether any ripple effects would reach other prime targets like Walmart and the expansive auto industry that has burgeoned across the South in recent decades. Both have largely succeeded at keeping unions at bay. The auto workers union has had some of the largest union pushes of the last decade, but their most intense and publicized efforts ended in failure. In 2017, a years-long campaign to unionize a Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi, ended with a decisive 2,244-1,307 rejection of the union — the kind of margin that would be devastating in Bessemer. Two years later, however, Volkswagen workers in Tennessee had a much more evenly split vote, with 776 workers supporting unionization and 833 voting against it. Besides the number of Amazon workers involved, the Alabama campaign has stood out because of how explicitly many advocates have linked the effort to the civil rights movement of the 20th century. The RWDSU estimates that more than 80% of the warehouse workers in Bessemer are Black. Robert Korstad, a Duke Emeritus professor and labor history expert, says those dynamics could help in Bessemer. “The history of the Black struggle in Alabama is pretty deeply entrenched in the social, political and religious institutions there,” he says. “We’re starting to see people rise up again. So this Amazon struggle is part of a larger struggle that’s gone on a long time.” The question, Korstad says, is whether a win in Bessemer truly becomes a “ripple effect” that inspires workers across racial and ethnic lines elsewhere."

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.8% in morning trading to 29,200.21. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 1.5% to 6,841.60. South Korea's Kospi was little changed, gaining less than 0.1% to 3,071.42. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.6% to 28,407.21, while the Shanghai Composite shed 0.9% to 3,424.44. A survey released Wednesday shows China’s factory activity rebounded in March from a three-month slowdown as export orders rose. The monthly index of manufacturing issued by the China’s statistics agency and an industry group rose to 51.9 from February’s 50.6 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. Chinese manufacturing has rebounded to above pre-pandemic levels in most industries but consumer and export demand have been slower to recover. Restrictions on trade in technology have also hurt exports, economists said. “Let’s reiterate that the technology war is the No. 1 risk faced by China in 2021. Chinese companies continue to face difficulties in buying and selling technology parts, products and services from companies on the U.S. entity list, which can include non-U.S. companies,” said Iris Pang, chief economist at IG. “Another risk, which is hopefully temporary, is the fragile recovery of export demand that comes from restrictive social distancing measures, and even lockdowns, in the U.S. and Europe,” Pang said in a commentary. U.S. stock indexes fell as another swell higher for Treasury yields pressured big technology stocks. Yields perked higher after a report showed consumers are even more confident than economists expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.74%. Its jump this year has forced investors to reconsider paying such high prices for many stocks, particularly the tech giants that were big winners earlier in the pandemic. Health care stocks also dragged shares lower, outweighing gains by banks, industrial stocks and companies that rely on consumer spending. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% to 3,958.55, its second decline in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3% from the all-time high it set a day before, to 33,066.96. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.1% to 13,045.39. The Russell 2000 rose 1.7%, to 2,195.80. Investors are awaiting details of President Joe Biden's proposals for spending perhaps even more than $3 trillion on infrastructure and other measures to help the economy and environment. Despite the pressure on big tech stocks, most professional investors remain optimistic that the broader market can keep rising. A stronger economy thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations and massive spending by the U.S. government should help boost profits for many companies this year, particularly those like banks, energy producers and industrial companies. Much of the market’s choppiness is reflecting that expectation. Investors have been shifting money away from companies like Amazon and Netflix, which benefited from a world on lockdown, to airlines, automakers and others that are poised to benefit from a broader reopening. “Big picture-wise, we’re moving in the direction of a rebalance trade,” said Greg Bassuk, chairman and CEO of AXS Investments. “In the next immediate period we’re going to continue to see significant volatility.” In energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude inched down 1 cent to $60.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 6 cents to $64.20 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 110.70 Japanese yen from 110.25 yen.

The federal government began distributing the third round of economic impact payments in mid-March to millions of Americans. But a paperwork delay temporarily held up payments to Social Security, Supplemental Security Income and Railroad Retirement Board beneficiaries who did not file a 2019 or 2020 tax return or did not use the tool made available on IRS website for non-filers. The IRS said Tuesday that it expects payments will be sent to those beneficiaries on April 7. The government needed updated beneficiary information to begin distributing the latest round of payments. After receiving data from the Social Security Administration on Thursday, the IRS began reviewing, validating, and testing tens of millions of records to ensure eligibility and proper calculation of the payments. If no additional issues arise, the IRS said it expects to complete that work and to begin processing these payments at the end of this week. Because the majority of the payments will be disbursed electronically, they would be received on April 7. The IRS updates its Get My Payment tool for eligible individuals once their payment is processed. The agency notes that the tool on IRS.gov will not be updated until this coming weekend with information for federal beneficiaries expecting payments next week. The IRS said it is still reviewing data received for Veterans Affairs benefit recipients and expects to determine a payment date and provide more details soon."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/volkswagen-issued-false-news-release-joke-76777376,business,Volkswagen hoaxes media with fake statement on name change,"DETROIT -- Volkswagen of America issued false statements this week saying it would change its brand name to “Voltswagen,” to stress its commitment to electric vehicles, only to reverse course Tuesday and admit that the supposed name change was a joke. Mark Gillies, a company spokesman, confirmed Tuesday that the statement had been a pre-April Fool's Day joke after having insisted Monday that the release was legitimate and the name change accurate. The company's false statement was distributed again Tuesday, saying the brand-name change reflected a shift to more battery-electric vehicles. Volkswagen's intentionally fake news release, highly unusual for a major public company, coincides with its efforts to repair its image as it tries to recover from a         2015 scandal in which it cheated on government emissions tests and allowed diesel-powered vehicles to illegally pollute the air. In that scandal,   admitted that about 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide were fitted with the deceptive software. The software reduced nitrogen oxide emissions when the cars were placed on a test machine but allowed higher emissions and improved engine performance during normal driving. The scandal cost   $35 billion (30 billion euros) in fines and civil settlements and led to the recall of millions of vehicles. The company's fake news release, leaked on Monday and then repeated in a mass e-mail to reporters Tuesday, resulted in articles about the name change in multiple media outlets, including The Associated Press. In falsely announcing a name change, the company went beyond telling reporters that its news release was legitimate. On Tuesday, the company emailed to reporters a press release that quoted its CEO announcing the fake change: “We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren’t changing is this brand’s commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere,” Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Volkswagen of America, said in the release. The fake release could land Volkswagen in trouble with U.S. securities regulators because its stock price rose nearly 5% on Tuesday, the day the bogus statement was officially issued. Investors of late have been responding positively to news of companies increasing electric vehicle production, swelling the value of shares of Tesla as well as of some EV startups. James Cox, who teaches corporate and securities law at Duke University, said the Securities and Exchange Commission should take action to deal with such misinformation, which can distort stock prices. “The whole market has gone crazy,” Cox said. “We need to throw a pretty clear line in the sand, I believe, about what is permissible and what isn’t permissible.” This week's Volkswagen incident bears some similarity to one in 2018 in which Tesla's CEO   tweeted that he had the funding secured to take the company private — a comment that drove up the stock price, Cox noted. Later, it was revealed that the funding had not been lined up.         Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million in penalties to the SEC. Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan, said he thought that for the SEC to be interested, it would have to believe that VW knowingly issued the fake news release to manipulate its stock price. “I don’t think the SEC is going to see this as stock price manipulation any more than when General Motors or Ford or Toyota or anybody talks about their (electric vehicle) future,” Gordon said. “It is incredibly stupid, but if being stupid were illegal, a third of the CEOs in the U.S. would be in jail.” A message was left Tuesday seeking a comment from the SEC. Late Tuesday, VW issued a statement confirming that it won't be changing its brand name to ""Voltswagen."" “The renaming was designed to be an announcement in the spirit of April Fool's Day,” the company said. Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University, said April Fool’s jokes are common in marketing. But he said it's rare for a company to deliberately mislead reporters. “The problem is that in the short run, you can fool people, and it seems cute and entertaining,"" Calkins said. ""But in the long run, you really do need positive and good relations with the media. For a company that already has credibility problems, this is really a strange move.” Calkins said that while the incident might not hurt VW with consumers, the company needs good relations with reporters to build its brand image over time."

The White House outline estimated 20,000 miles (32,187 kilometers) of roadways would be repaired, while economically significant bridges and 10,000 smaller bridges would get fixed. — $85 billion for public transit, doubling the federal government's commitment in an effort to shorten the repair backlog and expand service. — $80 billion to modernize Amtrak's heavily trafficked Northeast Corridor line, address its repair backlog and improve freight rail. — $174 billion to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, electrify 20% of school buses and electrify the federal fleet, including U.S. Postal Service vehicles. — $25 billion to upgrade air travel and airports and $17 billion for waterways and coastal ports. — $20 billion to redress communities whose neighborhoods — typically nonwhite — were divided by highway projects. — $50 billion to improve infrastructure resilience in the aftermath of natural disasters. — $111 billion to replace lead water pipes and upgrade sewer systems. — $100 billion to build high-speed broadband that provides 100% coverage for the country. — $100 billion to upgrade the resilience of the power grid and move to clean electricity, among other power projects. — $213 billion to produce, preserve and retrofit more than 2 million affordable houses and buildings. — $100 billion to upgrade and build new schools. — $18 billion to modernize Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics, and $10 billion for federal buildings. — $400 billion to expand long-term care services under Medicaid. — $180 billion invested in research and development projects. — $300 billion for manufacturing, including funds for the computer chip sector, improved access to capital and investment in clean energy through federal procurement. — $100 billion for workforce development. TAX INCREASES Biden's plan would finance projects by: — Raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, one of the measures that over 15 years would cover the cost of the infrastructure program and then help to reduce the budget deficit. — Imposing a 21% global minimum tax, so that companies cannot avoid   by shifting income to low-tax countries. — Making it harder for businesses to merge with foreign companies to avoid U.S. taxes, a process known as inversion. — Eliminating tax breaks for companies that shift assets abroad, and denying deductions for offshoring jobs. — Imposing a 15% minimum tax on the income that corporations report to shareholders. — Eliminating tax preferences for the fossil fuels sector. — Increasing IRS audits of large corporations."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-protects-younger-teens-76785747,business,Pfizer says its COVID-19 vaccine protects younger teens,"Pfizer announced Wednesday that its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and strongly protective in kids as young as 12, a step toward possibly beginning shots in this age group before they head back to school in the fall. Most COVID-19   being rolled out worldwide are for adults, who are at higher risk from the  . Pfizer’s vaccine is authorized for ages 16 and older. But vaccinating children of all ages will be critical to stopping the pandemic — and helping schools, at least the upper grades, start to look a little more normal after months of disruption. In a study of 2,260 U.S. volunteers ages 12 to 15, preliminary data showed there were no cases of COVID-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared to 18 among those given dummy shots, Pfizer reported. It's a small study, that hasn't yet been published, so another important piece of evidence is how well the shots revved up the kids’ immune systems. Researchers reported high levels of virus-fighting antibodies, somewhat higher than were seen in studies of young adults. Kids had side effects similar to young adults, the company said. The main side effects are pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety. Dr. Philip J. Landrigan of Boston College said the results are encouraging. “It’s hard to get kids to comply with masking and distancing, so something that gives them hard protection and takes them out of the mix of spreading the virus is all for the good,” said Landrigan , who was not involved in the study. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech in the coming weeks plan to ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulators to allow emergency use of the shots starting at age 12. “We share the urgency to expand the use of our vaccine,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. He expressed “the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year"" in the United States. Pfizer isn’t the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Results also are expected by the middle of this year from a U.S. study of Moderna’s vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds. But in a sign that the findings were promising, the FDA already allowed both companies to         begin U.S. studies  in children 11 and younger, working their way to as young as 6-month-old. “We are longing for a normal life. This is especially true for our children,” BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said in a statement. AstraZeneca last month began a study of its vaccine among 6- to 17-year-olds in Britain. Johnson & Johnson is planning its own pediatric studies. And in China, Sinovac recently announced it has submitted preliminary data to Chinese regulators showing its vaccine is safe in children as young as 3. While most COVID-19   being used globally were first tested in tens of thousands of adults, pediatric studies won’t need to be nearly as large. Scientists have safety information from those studies and from subsequent vaccinations in millions more adults. One key question is the dosage: Pfizer gave the 12-and-older participants the same dose adults receive, while testing different doses in younger children. It's not clear how quickly the FDA would act on Pfizer's request to allow vaccination starting at age 12. The agency has taken about three weeks to review and authorize each of the vaccines currently available for adults. That process included holding a public meeting of outside experts to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of each shot. The process for reviewing data in children could be shorter, given FDA’s familiarity with each vaccine. An agency spokeswoman said the FDA had no information to share on how the review would work, including whether additional public meetings would be required. Another question is when the country would have enough supply of shots — and people to get them into adolescents' arms — to let kids start getting in line. Supplies are set to steadily increase over the spring and summer, at the same time states are opening vaccinations to younger, healthier adults who until now haven't had a turn. Children represent about 13% of COVID-19 cases documented in the U.S. And while children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill, at least 268 have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. alone and more than 13,500 have been hospitalized, according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics. That’s more than die from the flu in an average year. Additionally, a small number have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus. Caleb Chung, who turns 13 later this week, agreed to volunteer after his father, a Duke University pediatrician, presented the option. He doesn't know if he received the vaccine or a placebo. “Usually I’m just at home doing online school and there’s not much I can really do to fight back against the virus,” Caleb said in a recent interview. The study “was really somewhere that I could actually help out.” His father, Dr. Richard Chung, said he’s proud of his son and all the other children volunteering for the needle pricks, blood tests and other tasks a study entails. “We need kids to do these trials so that kids can get protected. Adults can’t do that for them,” Chung said. ——— AP video journalist Federica Narancio contributed to this report. ——— The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/amid-astrazeneca-setback-germany-banks-homegrown-vaccine-76789321,business,"Amid AstraZeneca setback, Germany banks on homegrown vaccine","MARBURG, Germany -- As   ponders how to accelerate its sluggish   vaccination campaign after         yet another hitch involving the AstraZeneca shot, a production facility in the historic pharmaceutical center of Marburg may hold part of the answer to reliable supply in the months and years ahead. BioNTech, the German company that developed the first widely used vaccine together with U.S. partner Pfizer, is busily starting up a production facility that it says can produce up to a billion doses this year alone. That estimate was raised from the original hopes for 700 million. The company, which had never brought a pharmaceutical product to market before, wowed the world last year when it got authorization to sell a completely new type of vaccine in Britain, the United States and Europe — three highly regulated markets for medical products. The active ingredient in the shot is messenger RNA, or mRNA, which contains the instructions for human cells to construct a harmless piece of the coronavirus called the spike protein. The human immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign, allowing it to mount a response against the virus upon infection. Scientists have known how to make mRNA for some time, but not for commercial mass production. “This is what makes it exciting from a scientific perspective, but also from a manufacturing perspective, to do it on such a large scale, in such a short period of time,” said Valeska Skilling, head of production at the plant. BioNTech only received approval Friday from the European Medicines Agency for the manufacture of the vaccine at the Marburg site, which was bought from Novartis last year. The site is located within a pharma industry cluster whose roots go back more than a century to Nobel Prize winner Emil von Behring, who developed the antitoxin for diptheria and tetanus. Globally, BioNTech and Pfizer now estimate they can manufacture 2.5 billion doses in 2021, half a billion more than forecast in February. To make that happen, some 400 employees are confronting the challenges of large-scale production involving around 50,000 separate steps, some of which require months of training. A crucial concern in handling mRNA, which is notoriously fragile, is rigorously avoiding outside contamination. Workers, who typically have degrees in disciplines such as biology or pharmacy, must wear two protective suits, boots and full-head coverings that take 20 minutes to put on. Last week the company showed journalists some of the production equipment, including the bioreactor, a metal drum where the mRNA is produced from raw material fed in by tubes and carefully monitored. One batch can contain enough mRNA for 8 million doses in a bag not much bigger than a large sack of rice. It is then filtered and combined with lipids, or fatty molecules, that form tiny particles which encapsulate the mRNA and protect it after injection into the human body. The final step is filling the vials, carried out by external partners. The German government has come under heavy fire at home for letting the European Union handle the procurement of  , resulting in a far more limited supply than that obtained by Britain or the United States. The safety and         supply troubles with another vaccine, made by British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, has further highlighted how reliant the EU is on research and manufacturing outside the bloc. Stung by the criticism, and conscious of Germany's upcoming national election, Berlin has thrown its weight behind the Marburg plant, helping push the necessary paperwork through the German bureaucracy. Christoph Krupp, the government's vaccine production czar, said companies are ramping up their capacity, buying new equipment and hiring more staff. Meanwhile, the government is trying to reassure them that those investments aren't going to go to waste. “We want to prepare ourselves to maintain the production structures that we are building up now in the medium term, because we do not know how the pandemic is evolving,” Krupp said. “We do not know how the virus mutates... we do not know if there will be another pandemic.” In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily, Krupp said this will require some level of state aid, and that the government is considering a vaccine production reserve of 500 million doses per quarter, or about 2 billion a year. In practice that means another one or two plants like the one in Marburg will be needed in the European Union. While these would likely prioritize orders placed by the bloc, there is no outright export ban on   from the EU, meaning other regions could benefit too. The government may be hoping that its investment will pay off. According to economists cited by Germany’s ifo-Institute, having a vaccine available at short notice could result in a net benefit for each German of up to $1,750 a year. ——— Jordans reported from Berlin. ——— Follow all of AP’s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic,         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak ."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/global-trade-rebounding-lagging-vaccinations-pose-threat-76790348,business,"Global trade rebounding, lagging vaccinations pose threat","FRANKFURT, Germany -- The World Trade Organization is raising its estimate for the rebound in global trade in goods but warning that the COVID-19 pandemic still poses the greatest threat to a recovery that is being hampered by lagging vaccinations, regional disparities and weakness in the service industry. Demand in North America should be a major factor driving rebounding demand for goods thanks to the large fiscal relief and stimulus spending by the U.S. government. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called for a better access to   for people in in poorer countries. Rapid development of   have given the world a chance to halt the pandemic, “but this opportunity could be squandered if large numbers of countries and people do not have equal access to vaccines, she said Wednesday. ""A rapid, global and equitable vaccine rollout is the best stimulus that we have,” Okonjo-Iweala said at a news conference presenting the annual trade forecast. She called for better distribution of vaccine production facilities across the world so poor countries do not have to “stand in line” for vaccines. “The inequity of access is glaring, and this cannot happen again,” Okonjo-Iweala said. That the container ship mishap that temporarily shut down freight traffic in the Suez Canal could cause so much disruption was a sign that trade in goods remains “relatively robust,” she said. Meanwhile, services businesses are in more trouble, and the balance of risks are tilted to the downside. The WTO said it expects merchandise trade to rise by 8.0% in 2021, after having fallen 5.3% in 2020. Trade growth should then slow to 4.0% in 2022, a recovery that will still leave trade below its pre-pandemic level. The 2020 drop was less than expected due to the robust second half rebound thanks to strong monetary and fiscal support by many governments. The Geneva-based international organization foresaw a slide of 9.2% in its estimate released in October. “Prospects for a quick recovery in world trade have improved as merchandise trade expanded more rapidly than expected in the second half of last year,” the WTO said in a statement. “The strong rebound in global trade since the middle of last year has helped soften the blow of the pandemic for people, businesses, and economies,” Okonjo-Iweala said. ""But as long as large numbers of people and countries are excluded from sufficient vaccine access, it will stifle growth, and risk reversing the   and economic recovery worldwide."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/robinhood-cans-confetti-unveils-celebratory-designs-76787886,business,"Robinhood cans the confetti, unveils new celebratory designs","NEW YORK -- The bursts of confetti that shower screens of Robinhood investors when they make their first trade — and serve as the punchline for critics who say the popular app treats investing like a game — are going away. Starting this week, Robinhood will begin retiring the confetti, which was meant to celebrate customers hitting milestones like making their first deposit or enabling new features, such as upgrading to its paid Gold-level membership. The last pops will go off next week, to be replaced with a suite of animations that are decidedly measured in pace, with nary a flake within them. “They're meant to be moments of pause, moments of understanding,” said Rich Bessel, head of design at Robinhood. Robinhood's popularity has exploded since it launched in 2013. Its commission-free trades and easy-to-use app have drawn in so many first-time investors and helped it grow so fast that the company is preparing to sell its own stock for the first time in an initial public offering. The confetti animations have been around since 2016, and critics say it's one of a number of techniques Robinhood uses to lure unsophisticated investors and keep them engaged with the app, where they may be making too many trades that are too risky for them. Massachusetts regulators last year cited the confetti in particular as part of           against Robinhood, alleging that it targets and manipulates inexperienced investors. A culture has built up on the internet where people post pictures of huge losses they took from bad trades — dubbed “loss porn” — and many show screenshots of their Robinhood account balances to prove it. Robinhood allows some investors to trade stock options and to buy using borrowed money, like other brokers, which can supercharge gains and losses. Madhu Muthukumar, Robinhood's senior director of product management, said the confetti criticism became a distraction that took away from the encouragement the company was trying to provide as people stepped into investing for the first time. The typical age for a Robinhood customer is 31, and many of them used to be among the nearly half of all U.S. households that don’t own any stocks or stock funds. Experts say it’s important to get more people invested in stocks, which historically have offered one of the best ways to build wealth over the long term. “So we just took out the distraction"" of the confetti, Muthukumar said. “For some reason, the conversation seemed centered around that."" In its response to the Massachusetts complaint, Robinhood said that digital confetti is legal and that the secretary of the commonwealth’s securities division ""also fails to appreciate that a first trade for many Robinhood customers — especially those who have been previously excluded from the markets — is an important milestone to celebrate."" Some research has also pushed back on the notion that traders on Robinhood are all making suckers' bets. When the stock market was plunging a year ago as the pandemic panic rocked global stock markets, for example, Robinhood investors didn't dump their holdings, as the stereotype of “dumb money” would suggest. Instead, they saw it as a chance to buy low and collectively increased their holdings, according to research by Ivo Welch, a finance professor at UCLA's Anderson School of Management. The S&P 500 has soared more than 50% over the last year. And experts aren't universally against the gamification of investing as a concept in general, if it helps bring more non-investors into the market. Chester Spatt, a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, said active trading of stocks may not be as beneficial over the long term as simply holding a low-cost stock index fund, even if the trading is commission free. But it can still be better than leaving your money in a savings account. “It's not an absolute evil because it is helping bring people into the capital markets,” Spatt said. ""And I think that’s a healthy thing, if people take away from that the right sort of lessons."""

The unadjusted jobless rate, the headline figure in  , slipped to 6.2% from 6.3% in February. Nearly 2.83 million people were registered as unemployed in the nation of 83 million — 77,000 fewer than the previous month and 492,000 more than a year earlier. In seasonally adjusted terms, the unemployment rate stood at 6% for the third consecutive month, though 8,000 fewer people were out of work than in February, the Federal Labor Agency said. Restaurants, bars, sports and many leisure facilities have been closed since Nov. 2 and hotels are allowed only to accommodate business travelers. Hairdressers and nonessential shops were able to reopen in March, with virus-related limits. However, infections have risen significantly in recent weeks and restrictions may be reimposed. Industry has not been directly affected by lockdown measures. Rises in unemployment in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, and elsewhere on the continent have been moderate by international standards. That is because employers are making heavy use of salary support programs, often referred to as furlough schemes, which allow them to keep employees on the payroll while they await better times. In Germany, the labor agency pays at least 60% of the salary of employees who are on reduced or zero hours. The labor agency said it paid support for 2.85 million people in December, the most recent month it has estimates for. That was up from 2.6 million in December but still far below a peak of nearly 6 million last April. Separately, Germany's statistics agency said Wednesday that the number of businesses filing for insolvency in 2020 dropped 15.5% from the year before to 15,841. That, however, was largely because, due to the pandemic, authorities suspended rules requiring overly indebted companies to file for insolvency."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/automakers-bmw-volvo-back-moratorium-deep-seabed-mining-76784243,business,"Automakers BMW, Volvo back moratorium on deep seabed mining","BERLIN -- Automakers   and Volvo announced Wednesday that they support a moratorium on deep seabed mining for minerals used in electric vehicle batteries and other products. In a statement also backed by Samsung’s EV battery unit and tech giant Google, the companies cited the importance of protecting fragile ocean ecosystems that are already under threat from overfishing, pollution, noise and man-made climate change. While deep seabed mining is still in its infancy, several prospecting firms are seeking rights to extract potentially lucrative deposits from the depths of the ocean, particularly the metallic nodules that build up around hydrothermal vents. “Before any potential deep seabed mining occurs, it needs to be clearly demonstrated that such activities can be managed in a way that ensures the effective protection of the marine  ,” the four companies said in their statement. “All alternatives to deep sea minerals must be explored as a matter of urgency, with a focus on reducing demand for primary metals, transitioning to a resource-efficient, closed-loop materials economy, and developing responsible terrestrial mining practices,” they said. The companies said they were committed “not to source minerals from the deep seabed; to exclude such minerals from our supply chains; and not to finance deep seabed mining activities.” The call was supported by the  al group World Wildlife Fund, which has campaigned against deep seabed mining. “We need to take pressures off the ocean, not add additional pressures to it in order to guarantee that the ocean can provide services to humanity, such as climate regulation, food and medicines, into the future,” said Jessica Battle, who heads the WWF campaign against deep seabed mining. While minerals mined from the ocean floor can be used for a variety of goods, they are of particular interest to high-tech industries that rely on precious and rare metals. “At least one of the leading nodule mining contractors, DeepGreen, cites generating metals for EV batteries as their major motivation for large-scale mining,” said Craig Smith, a professor of oceanography at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management in Germany, said the announcement by BMW and Volvo was significant for other car manufacturers. “It underlines the importance of ecological considerations in a comprehensive well-to-wheel perspective,"" he said, adding that other automakers “will now at least hesitate to use minerals mined from the ocean in their electric vehicle batteries.” Global Sea Mineral Resources, a company exploring deep seabed mining, said it supports the call for a moratorium but claimed environmental surveys are already required by the International Seabed Authority, which regulates the industry. “GSR will only apply for a mining contract if the science shows that, from an environmental and social perspective, deep seabed minerals have advantages over the alternative – which is to rely solely on new and current mines on land,” said Kris van Nijen, the company’s managing director."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/edmunds-puts-teslas-range-test-76787921,business,Edmunds puts Tesla's range to the test,"Edmunds’ test team recently published the results of its real-world range testing for electric vehicles. Notably, every Tesla the team tested in 2020 came up short of matching the EPA’s range estimate. Almost all other EVs Edmunds tested met or exceeded those estimates. That result, as you can likely guess, ruffled some feathers at Tesla headquarters. A CHALLENGE FROM TESLA The lackluster results prompted the automaker to reach out to the Edmunds test team. Tesla’s engineers disputed our figures and argued that by stopping our EV range tests at zero indicated miles, rather than pressing on until the battery died, we were underestimating their vehicles’ true range. Tesla said its vehicles have a safety buffer that ensures drivers can keep going even when the indicated range displayed zero miles. And when you factored in this buffer, Tesla argued, it would allow their vehicles to match the EPA range estimates, which are typically measured when the battery is fully depleted. It was a challenge we at Edmunds were up for, so we rented a 7.5-mile-long closed-course oval at an unaffiliated automaker’s proving ground in California’s Mojave Desert. This facility allowed us to safely drive five EVs until their battery power completely ran out. Tesla provided a Model 3 Long Range for us to test. We also brought along the Edmunds-owned Model 3 Standard Range Plus and Model Y Performance used in our original range testing, plus two non-Teslas for comparison purposes: a Ford Mustang Mach-E and an   ID.4. These were also provided by their manufacturers. THE TEST Most in-car range meters factor in your recent driving habits when forecasting the remaining range. Edmunds’ editors needed to drive the vehicles in the same manner to normalize the range meters and provide a level playing field. At the test track, we drove the five EVs at a common highway speed of 65 mph, with the automatic climate control set to 72 degrees, audio off, no accessories plugged in, and with drivers rotating in one-hour shifts, until the batteries were depleted. Once each vehicle’s range estimate indicated zero miles, we measured how far it could go before coming to a complete stop. Miles Traveled Past Zero Ford Mustang Mach-E Extended Range: 7.3 miles Tesla Model Y Performance: 12.6 miles Volkswagen ID.4: 12.9 miles Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus: 17.6 miles Tesla Model 3 Long Range: 25.9 miles Notice how the buffer can vary even within the same brand. The Model 3 Long Range went twice as far as the Model Y. What’s more, there was no indication how far you could keep going since all vehicles simply read zero miles remaining. For all we knew, the cars could stop at any moment. BOLSTERING OUR RESULTS We also ran a control test on the Edmunds’ EV range route with the Model 3 Long Range and Model Y Performance, driving them to the end of their battery life on public roads. The Model Y traveled 11 miles past zero and the Model 3 went an extra 17.5 miles; both were less than the buffers we experienced at the test track. We asked Tesla about this discrepancy in the reserve range. The automaker said that the buffer was based on a combination of near-past conditions and instantaneous conditions, essentially the weather and terrain variation, which was why “the buffer cannot be defined exactly to a number every time.” TAKEAWAYS FOR THE EV SHOPPER Some Teslas would be capable of meeting their EPA estimates in Edmunds’ real-world range test if we included their reserve battery range, or the distance we traveled running beyond the point of zero indicated miles left. But even in this scenario, there would be requirements such as driving conservatively in a temperate climate and using Tesla’s maximum battery charge, even though Tesla recommends this for long-distance trips only. The majority of Teslas we’ve tested so far — four of the six — do not meet their EPA estimates even allowing for a safety buffer. Furthermore, almost every other EV Edmunds has tested met or exceeded EPA estimates without the need to include their safety buffers. Potential Tesla shoppers should know that to use the full range as advertised, they need to feel comfortable going past the zero indicated mile mark. This is not only risky, but it also requires the owner to deeply discharge the battery, which isn’t recommended for the long-term health of the battery. EDMUNDS SAYS: Edmunds’ EV range test isn’t meant to be the definitive word on a vehicle’s range but rather a real-world complement to the laboratory-based EPA testing. We’ll continue to test to an indicated zero because we’d never advise customers to rely on the unpredictable buffer range. ——————— This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website         Edmunds.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/sports-cards-virtual-big-76789324,business,"Sports cards have gone virtual, and in a big way","SILVER SPRING, Md. -- Maybe the Luka Doncic rookie   card that recently sold at auction for a record $4.6 million was a bit rich for your blood. Perhaps you’d be interested in a more affordable alternative — say, a virtual card of the Dallas Mavericks forward currently listed for a mere $150,000? Not long ago, there’s no way you’d plunk down even $1.50 for a digital image that could be copied for free. But sports trading cards have gone convincingly digital, complete with rare collector’s items and the adrenaline rush of opening a fresh pack -- minus the stale, shattered plank of powdery bubblegum you might remember from childhood. These digital cards, dubbed “moments,” appear on screen as spinning, floating digital cubes that each feature a video highlight of an NBA player. They sprang into existence just five months ago, after the Canadian tech startup Dapper Labs convinced the NBA that it could not only prevent cheap -- well, free -- knock-offs, it could help the NBA make a few bucks in the process. Dapper announced Tuesday that it had secured $305 million in new private funding from a group that includes former NBA great Michael Jordan and more than a dozen current players. The company said the new round of funding will help it expand its NFT and blockchain products to other sports leagues and a wide range of businesses. What makes all this possible is a clever use of the cryptocurrency technology called blockchain, which allows the creation of permanent certificates of ownership that can't be copied or deleted. It's the same technique that recently allowed the artist known as Beeple to sell a digital work for almost $70 million. Most moments -- typically ones in heavy circulation -- cost around $20 and often below $10. Of course, the biggest transactions — a LeBron James dunk recently went for $210,000 — get the most attention. Despite some early tech hiccups, the NBA says it is “thrilled” with the response from fans, who bombard the Top Shot website every time new packs of cards drop. Each such pack drop injects thousands of new cards into the market, offering buyers an affordable way to add to their collections. The cheapest packs have three “common” cards and cost $9. More expensive packs with more and rarer cards can cost almost $1000. Fans halfway around the world are setting their alarms in the middle of the night just to get in line for a chance to buy a pack. Videos of the flashy pack openings are logging tens of thousands of views all over YouTube. Even NBA players are getting in on the action. “I’m not going to lie, it makes me feel like I’m a kid again,” Orlando Magic guard Terrence Ross said. “At lunch, at school trading NBA cards -- it’s fun.” Since the beta went live in October, Top Shot says it has registered more than 800,000 users and rung up nearly $500 million in sales. March sales should easily surpass February sales of $232 million, which was about five times January turnover. “It’s happened really quickly,” said Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou. “We’re sort of scrambling to keep up.” After a year of playing games to empty arenas amid the pandemic, the NBA is ecstatic about the frenzy. Dapper Labs, the NBA and its players share a 5% fee on peer-to-peer transactions; the league also gets a cut of the pack drop sales. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told The Associated Press: “I think we’re just scratching the surface on what the potential is for blockchain to completely transform the digital collectibles industry.” Yes, he said “blockchain.” Each Top Shot card comes with a non-fungible token, or NFT, that confirms an item’s ownership by recording the details on a decentralized digital ledger known as the blockchain. NFTs can be used to trace an object’s digital origin, allowing one to prove ownership. It also creates a somewhat artificial scarcity that can juice a product’s value. Aaron Perzanowski, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University and co-author of the book “The End of Ownership,” said the NFT craze is partly a response to consumers’ genuine desire to reclaim a sense of ownership in an increasingly digital, intangible economy. “Granted, right now, that desire is expressing itself through a seemingly frivolous and exploitative trend that, to most of us, looks irrational,” Perzanowski said. Gharegozlou insists that Top Shot won’t end up like Dapper's previous project, CryptoKitties, a digital cat-breeding and trading game that saw virtual cats selling for six figures before crashing. The company said problems that plagued CryptoKitties -- skyrocketing blockchain costs and the inability to control its digital inventory — aren't an issue for Top Shot. Dapper promotes Top Shot as both a fun hobby for collectors and an opportunity for investors. “It's like stock market investing reimagined for fans,” according to one promotional email. Just like anyone starting to invest in stocks, novice Top Shot investors would be wise to learn the vernacular, study the marketplace and listen to more experienced players. Because all minted cards and transactions are openly documented on the blockchain, a growing number of websites crunch that data for users to analyze before buying or selling. There are also free tutorials on the internet. Cards are valued by several different factors, including some unique measures based on their serial numbers. Unsurprisingly, moments of the league’s best players tend to be more valuable. The rarer a moment is, the more expensive it's likely to be. The lower the card number is in a series, the more it should fetch on the market. And if your ownership serial number happens to match the jersey number of the player featured? Ka-ching. Dean Brostek, who runs a sports consultancy and data intelligence business in Melbourne, Australia, considers himself both a collector and investor. The 43-year-old's interest in the NBA had waned until his teenage son picked up   a few years ago. Then he read about Top Shot and decided to give it a whirl. After a few misses, some related to dealing with the 18-hour time difference in the wee hours, Brostek finally got his pack, opened it with his kids and posted the video online. “It was really cool,” he said. “They’ve done a really nice job of creating a bit of theater.”"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/deliveroo-shares-tumble-uk-stock-market-debut-76784906,business,Deliveroo shares slump in UK IPO as investors lose appetite,"LONDON -- Shares of app-based meal delivery service Deliveroo, which saw its business boosted by pandemic lockdowns, tumbled by as much as a third in their U.K.   debut on Wednesday. The London-based company's shares slid even after they were priced at the bottom of the potential range, reflecting investor wariness about whether Deliveroo could turn a profit and broader market turbulence for tech-related stocks. The slump also reflects a growing backlash against “gig economy"" companies, with half a dozen leading U.K. fund managers abstaining from the IPO amid concerns about working conditions for Deliveroo's delivery riders, and its shareholder structure. Shares in Deliveroo Holdings, which competes with Uber Eats and whose backers include Amazon, ended the day down 26% from their offer price of 390 pence, after falling as much as a third in early trading. Deliveroo's initial public offering was one of Europe's biggest and most hotly anticipated this year. The company raised 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) from selling new shares, while existing shareholders sold another 500 million pounds worth of shares, in a   listing that values the company at 7.6 billion pounds. Founded by CEO Will Shu, an American ex-banker, Deliveroo operates in a dozen countries in Europe and Asia. Every month more than 6 million customers order food from restaurants and shops through the Deliveroo app, according to its prospectus. Bicycle and scooter riders lugging insulated bags in the company’s signature robin’s egg blue are ubiquitous on the streets of London. “In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work,” Shu         said in a statement. Deliveroo has never turned a profit since it was founded in 2013 though it benefited last year from the coronavirus pandemic, which helped narrow its annual loss to $309 million. Lockdown restrictions sent demand for takeout food soaring and increased its overall transactions, but analysts wonder if the lift will last. “The pandemic has offered a structural growth opportunity, but it’s worth asking if lockdowns mean things are as good as they will ever be for a takeaway service,"" Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a research note. ""The longer-term outlook depends on how demand holds up in a post-pandemic world, and if that road to profitability looks any clearer.” Wave Roberts, a Deliveroo motorcycle rider in Reading, England, said any pandemic revenue bump “came out of our pocket as couriers,” because the company has been cutting its fees. Deliveroo pays up to 3.30 pounds for a delivery up to 1 mile from a restaurant, down from 5.10 pounds three years ago, said Roberts, who's also vice chair of a couriers' union. After deducting expenses including fuel, insurance and taxes, Roberts takes home about 7 pounds an hour, less than the U.K. minimum wage. As part of the IPO, Deliveroo promised longtime riders bonuses of up to 10,000 pounds. Roberts, who didn't get anything, dismissed it as a public relations exercise by the company “to make them look ethical and friendly."" Some of the U.K.’s biggest fund managers lost their appetite for investing over similar concerns. One fund manager, M&G, said Deliveroo's reliance on gig workers presented a risk to “the sustainability of its business model."" Having a flexible workforce has been key to the company's success, but the threat of tighter regulation looms. The U.K.'s top court recently ruled that Uber drivers should be classed as “workers"" and not self-employed, entitling them to benefits such as minimum wage and pensions. ——— For all of AP’s tech coverage, visit         https://apnews.com/apf-technology ——— Follow Kelvin Chan at www.twitter.com/chanman"

US home contract signings tumble, now lag year-ago pace","SILVER SPRING, Md. -- The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes last month fell by the most since last year's virus outbreak sent the economy into freefall. The National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales tumbled 10.6% to 110.3 in February, its lowest level since May of last year. Combined with a 2.4% dip in January, contract signings are now 0.5% behind where they were last year after eight straight months of year-over-year gains. Contract signings are considered a barometer of purchases that will take place in the next two months. Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reported that home construction fell sharply, slipping 10.3% in February due to severe winter weather in much of the country. Applications for new building permits, considered a good indication of future activity, fell for the first time since October. Even though interest rates have ticked up recently, economists have been optimistic that housing will bounce back in coming months. Rising demand has been fueled by Americans who have been cooped up as the   pandemic drags on past the one-year mark. Contract signings in all four regions fell in February and all are now behind last year's pace. The Midwest is lagging behind last year by the most, with a decline of 6.1%. The South, West and Northeast are all between about 2% and 4% behind last year's pace."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ap-norc-poll-biden-bolstered-strong-marks-pandemic-76794014,business,AP-NORC poll: Biden bolstered by strong marks on pandemic,"WASHINGTON -- Americans are broadly supportive of President  ’s early handling of the   pandemic, a new poll finds, and approval of his stewardship of the economy has ticked up following passage of a sprawling         $1.9 trillion relief bill. But Americans are more critical of Biden’s early approach to some of the hot-button issues that are moving to the forefront, including guns and  , according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The president has outlined goals for tackling both issues but has made clear that they are not his immediate legislative priorities. “I’m going to deal with all those problems. The question is the priorities as they come and land on my plate,” Biden said in a news conference last week. Biden's early weeks in office have made it abundantly clear that his top priority is curtailing the pandemic: urging Americans to take precautionary measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, prioritizing the rollout of   and pushing the relief bill through Congress in a party line vote. Vaccine distribution has soared since Biden took office, with more than 96 million Americans having received at least one dose. Americans have responded favorably to the president's approach, with 73% approving of his handling of the pandemic. That includes about half of Republicans, a rarity given how divided Americans have been along party lines on many key issues in recent years. Gwen Medley, a nurse from Galveston, Texas, who has been administering   in her state, is among them. The 66-year-old Republican is critical of Biden on a range of other issues, including immigration, but said the president is doing a “pretty good job” on the pandemic so far — in part, she says, because of vaccine efforts he inherited from the Trump administration. “Trump got the ball rolling, and Biden is continuing to push that ball,” Medley said. Notably, Biden’s approval rating on the economy has ticked up slightly since passage of the relief bill, which included direct payments to millions of Americans and aid to schools and state and local governments. Sixty percent of Americans now say they approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, compared with 55%         a month ago. Overall, Biden’s job approval sits at a healthy 61% as he enters his third month in office, according to the AP-NORC survey. That's well above the approval ratings for his predecessor, Donald Trump, at this same point in his presidency. Trump's overall approval rating never topped 50% in an AP-NORC survey. Biden and his advisers contend that despite the litany of issues facing the country, he will be judged foremost on his handling of the pandemic, now in its second year. The virus has killed more than 550,000 people in the U.S., and even with vaccines more accessible, some states are experiencing a surge in cases as new variants take hold. “Our work is far from over,” Biden said this week as he implored states to keep mask mandates and other restrictions in place. “The war against COVID-19 is far from won. This is deadly serious.” Much of Biden's efforts have been in sharp contrast to Trump, who emphasized the need to keep businesses open and the U.S. economy humming, even if that meant flouting public health guidelines for controlling the pandemic. Biden has flipped that approach, but also tried to supplement the economy through the legislation he signed into law in early March. No Republicans in Congress voted for the measure, with some arguing that it unnecessarily added to the federal budget deficit at a time when the economy was already moving in a more positive direction. Americans are split over Biden's handling of the deficit, with 48% saying they approve and 50% saying they disapprove. The majority of Democrats — 77% — approve, while the majority of Republicans — 83% — disapprove. Biden faces a similar partisan divide on gun policy and immigration, two issues that have quickly disrupted Biden's carefully laid plans for his opening months in office. On gun policy, 45% say they back Biden's approach, while 52% disapprove. The survey was conducted after a pair of deadly mass shootings, one in Atlanta that killed eight people, including six Asian Americans, and another at a grocery store in Colorado that left 10 people dead. Biden         has said he's considering executive actions to tighten gun restrictions, but has also said he believes “rational” legislation could pass the narrowly divided Senate. He's called on the Senate, in particular, to pass measures already approved by the House that would expand background checks, though he's putting his own political muscle first into a $2 trillion infrastructure package the White House unveiled this week. Biden is also         confronting mounting concerns along the U.S.-Mexico border, where the number of families and migrant children arriving is on the rise. Republicans have blamed the increases on Biden's swift rollback of some of Trump's most aggressive immigration deterrent policies, moves the White House has warned should not be viewed as an open invitation to cross the border. The White House, in turn, has blamed the situation at the border in large part on the conditions it inherited from the Trump administration. In addition to his executive actions, Biden has unveiled a legislative proposal that would provide an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of people currently in the U.S. illegally. So far, just 42% say they approve of how Biden is handling immigration, and a similar share, 44%, say they approve of how he’s handling border security. While much of Biden's early focus has been on domestic matters, foreign policy concerns also loom. The president has a 55% approval rating on foreign policy, putting that issue slightly below his overall job performance. The poll also finds Americans cite the threat to the U.S. from the spread of infectious diseases and the threat from extremist militant groups as among their top concerns, along with China's influence around the world. Democrats and Republicans have differing concerns about the greatest threats facing the United States. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to cite the spread of infectious diseases (69% to 47%), extremist militant groups (67% to 51%) and climate change (76% to 22%) as threats to the U.S. They also are slightly more concerned about Russia's global influence (50% to 42%). Republicans are more likely than Democrats to be very concerned about the threat posed by illegal immigration (72% to 22%), China’s influence around the world (68% to 44%), the Iranian nuclear program (58% vs 39%), and the North Korean nuclear program (51% to 41%). ——— The AP-NORC poll of 1,166 adults was conducted March 26-29 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

The new budget was approved at a late night session at 129 trillion  i dinars ($89 billion) and a budget deficit estimated at 28.7 trillion trillion  i dinars ($19.79 billion). The 2021 budget set an oil price of $45 a barrel with expected oil exports of 3.25 million barrels per day. Oil-rich Iraq is going through an acute economic and financial crisis largely due to low crude prices. In December, Iraq's Central Bank devalued the Iraqi dinar by over 20% in response to a severe liquidity crisis, a measure that sparked public outrage as the government struggled to cover its expenses. It was the first reduction in exchange rates that the Iraqi government has made in decades. Since an oil price crash last year, Iraq has been grappling with an unprecedented liquidity crisis. The crude-exporting country has had to borrow from the bank’s dollar reserves to pay the nearly $5 billion in monthly fees for public salaries and pensions. Oil revenues, which account for 90% of the budget, have brought in an average of $3.5 billion. Efforts to introduce reforms have been met with opposition and to date, the government has been borrowing internally to foot state bills. The 2020 budget was not passed due to political deadlock. The parliament on Wednesday also voted to dissolve itself on October 7, three days before Iraq is to hold general  s."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/yellen-regulatory-panel-2020-market-turmoil-76797883,business,Yellen says regulatory panel to look at 2020 market turmoil,"WASHINGTON -- Last year’s  -triggered market turmoil exposed vulnerable areas in the U.S. economy that need to be addressed by the nation's top-level financial supervisory group, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday. Yellen told members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council that she wants the panel to examine what needs to be done to better protect the financial system from further turmoil. It should also study the impact of climate change on the stability of financial institutions, she said. “Almost exactly one year ago, the pandemic’s outbreak caused significant stress in the economy and in the financial system,” Yellen told the panel during its public session. “In response to the deep uncertainty, investors sought safety in the form of cash and sort-term government securities. Bond markets became illiquid.” Yellen said that the country is now “digging out of a deep hole,” but she said the hole could have been even deeper if not for swift rescue actions by the Federal Reserve, Treasury and Congress and by the regulations passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. “But the fact that extreme policy interventions were still required to support market functioning should serve as a clear reminder: We have to do more to address vulnerabilities in the financial system,” Yellen said. Her comments marked a change in tone from the Trump administration. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other panel members searched for ways to lessen the burden of financial regulations that had been imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The stability panel, which was created by the Dodd-Frank law to address failures to coordinate oversight, includes the heads of government regulatory agencies including Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission. While Wednesday’s session was Yellen’s first as chair of the panel, she had served as a member for the four years she served as chair of the Fed. Yellen said the examination of last year’s financial market turmoil would include a review of potential reforms for money market mutual funds and the operation of hedge funds. Yellen said the council’s review would also address ways to make the Treasury securities market more resilient to future disruptions. The council will also examine ways to make financial institutions more resilient to the threats imposed by climate change, she said. “We know that storms will hit us with more frequency and more intensity,” Yellen said. “Our financial system must be prepared for the market and credit risks of these climate-related events.”"

One Rock Capital Partners, in partnership with Metropoulos & Co., assumed ownership of brands including Poland Spring, Deer Park, Arrowhead, Ozarka, Zephyrhills and Pure Life. Dean Metropoulos, who led turnarounds at Hostess Brands and Pabst Brewing Co., will serve as chairman and interim CEO of the new company. The new company hopes to reinvigorate bottled water sales in the U.S., where sales growth has slowed even though the sector has seen growth every year since the 2009 recession. Nestle’s North American water business had 27 production facilities and more than 7,000 employees. The Swiss-based company said it intends to sharpen its focus on its international premium water brands, including Perrier, S. Pellegrino and Acqua Panna, which were not included in the deal."

The company had previously given its return-to-office date as June 30, but questions remained as to whether the company would allow some of its 60,000 Seattle-area office employees to continue working from home part time. The Seattle Times         reports the company told employees Tuesday it is planning a “return to an office-centric culture as our baseline.” Amazon and Microsoft were among the first large companies to mostly shutter their main offices in the Seattle area during the first COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. Amazon will not require office workers to receive a COVID-19 vaccine before they return, but the company is encouraging employees and contractors to get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible, according to   spokesperson Jose Negrete. Microsoft had previously said it would begin bringing workers back to its suburban Seattle global headquarters on March 29 Seattle-based Zillow announced last summer that it will give its roughly 5,400 employees nationwide the option to work remotely for good."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/unwelcome-prank-volkswagen-purposely-hoodwinks-reporters-76780835,business,An unwelcome prank: Volkswagen purposely hoodwinks reporters,"NEW YORK -- Journalists are used to being wary about odd pranksters pulling April Fool's Day hoaxes at this time of year. Few expect it from a multi-billion dollar corporation. Volkswagen admitted Tuesday that it had put out a false news release saying that it had changed the name of its U.S. subsidiary to “Voltswagen of America” in an attempt to be funny and promote a new electric utility vehicle. Several news organizations, including The Associated Press, USA Today, CNBC and The Washington Post, had reported the original press release as real news, some after being assured specifically that it was no joke. The deception even briefly lifted stock prices for the company, according to         The Wall Street Journal, which first revealed the deception by reaching an official at the company headquarters in Germany. “The Associated Press was repeatedly assured by Volkswagen that its U.S. subsidiary planned a name change, and reported that information, which we now know to be false,"" company spokeswoman Lauren Easton said. “We have corrected our story and published a new one based on the company’s admission. This and any deliberate release of false information hurts accurate journalism and the public good.” The story emerged Monday after a news release was briefly posted on a company website and then disappeared, but not before catching some eyes. CNBC, which declined comment on the hoax, is believed to be the first major news organization to report it as legitimate news. The AP wrote a story about it Monday after its reporter was assured by Mark Gillies, a company spokesman in the United States, that it was serious, Easton said. It was a similar story at USA Today, where a reporter specifically asked if it was a joke and was told “no,” said the newspaper's spokeswoman, Chrissy Terrell. “The company used this fake announcement as a way to manipulate respected reporters from trusted news outlets to get attention for their marketing campaign,” she said. “We are disheartened that the company would choose this type of disingenuous marketing.” The USA Today reporter who was initially lied to was more blunt. “This was not a joke,” reporter         Nathan Bomey wrote on Twitter. “It was deception. In case you haven't noticed, we have a misinformation problem in this country. Now you're part of it. Why should anyone trust you again?” At first on Tuesday, the company doubled down on its story by reissuing the news release, which quoted Scott Keogh, the president and CEO of Volkswagen of America. It even changed its Twitter page, announcing that “we know, 66 is an unusual age to change your name, but we've always been young at heart.” There's some precedent for a company trying a “fake news” joke. In 2018,         the food chain IHOP briefly tried to convince consumer it was exchanging the “P"" in its name to “B,” trading pancakes for burgers. Gillies, after presenting the false information the day before, came clean on Tuesday. The Journal quoted a spokesman for the company in Germany as saying, “we didn't mean to mislead anyone. The whole thing is just a marketing action to get people talking” about its new car model. The AP and other news organizations that falsely reported the news later wrote about the hoax. “About that plan to change Volkswagen of America's name.” wrote USA Today's Mike Snider. “Never mind.” “Perhaps we should consider whether (the) marketing campaign was funnier in the original German?” said Juleanna Glover, a corporate consultant and founder of the firm Ridgely Walsh. Glover said the company landed millions of dollars in publicity from a press release. “I am sure VW regrets the move for now but a good marketing team will find the path to capitalize on the word play,” she said. Shon Hiatt, a professor of management and organization at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, said campaigns with humor aren't necessarily problematic if presented in a tongue-in-cheek way and not as falsehoods to reporters. “I don't think it will hurt them,” Hiatt said. “I just don't think it gave them the full potential boost they wanted.” ——— AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton in Los Angeles contributed to this report."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-batch-fails-quality-76799269,business,Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine batch fails quality check,"A batch of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine failed quality standards and can’t be used, the drug giant said Wednesday. The drugmaker didn’t say how many doses were lost, and it wasn’t clear how the problem would impact future deliveries. A vaccine ingredient made by Emergent BioSolutions — one of about 10 companies that Johnson & Johnson is using to speed up manufacturing of its recently approved vaccine — did not meet quality standards, J&J said. J&J said the Emergent BioSolutions factory involved had not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make part of the vaccine. Emergent declined to comment. J&J had pledged to provide 20 million doses of its vaccine to the U.S. government by the end of March, and 80 million more doses by the end of May. Its statement on the manufacturing problem said it was still planning to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June and was “aiming to deliver those doses by the end of May.” President Joe Biden has pledged to have enough vaccines for all U.S. adults by the end of May. The U.S. government has ordered enough two-dose shots from Pfizer and Moderna to vaccinate 200 million people to be delivered by late May, plus the 100 million shots from J&J. A federal official said Wednesday evening the administration’s goal can be met without additional J&J doses. A J&J spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the company met the end-of-March goal, but did not respond to questions about whether the Emergent plant in Baltimore, known as Bayview, had been cleared by FDA. As of Wednesday, J&J had provided about 6.8 million doses to the U.S. vaccine effort, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s online vaccine tracker. Some additional doses may not yet have been recorded as delivered, and federal health officials said Wednesday that another 11 million doses of the vaccine would be available for shipments starting on Thursday. It was not immediately clear where those 11 million doses originated, but J&J has been shipping finished vaccines from its factory in the Netherlands to the U.S. Emergent, a little known pharmaceutical company granted a major role in the federal government’s response to coronavirus pandemic, has been repeatedly cited by the FDA for problems ranging from poorly trained employees to cracked vials and mold around one of its facilities, according to records obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. The records cover inspections at Emergent facilities, including Bayview, since 2017. Following a December 2017 inspection at an Emergent plant in Canton, Massachusetts, the FDA said the company hadn’t corrected “continued low level mold and yeast isolates” found in the facility. Nearly a year later, agency investigators questioned why Emergent had “an unwritten policy of not conducting routine compliance audits” at a separate plant in Baltimore, known as Camden, where an anthrax vaccine is filled into vials. Emergent’s revenues skyrocketed during the Trump administration, jumping from around $523 million in 2015 to more than $1.5 billion in 2020. The company has invested heavily in lobbying the federal government, according to disclosure records, which show the company spent $3.6 million on lobbying in 2020 alone. J&J said it was putting more of its manufacturing and quality experts inside Emergent’s factory to supervise production of the COVID-19 vaccine, a move meant to enable delivery of an additional 24 million vaccine doses through April. J&J said it still expects to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. The J&J vaccine has been viewed as crucial for vaccination campaigns around the world, because only one shot is required and it can be shipped and stored at standard refrigeration temperatures, unlike some other vials that must be kept frozen. The company also has pledged to sell the vaccine without a profit, but only during the pandemic emergency. The problem with the vaccine batch was first reported by The New York Times. The FDA said it was aware of the situation but declined further comment. ——— Johnson reported from Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, and Lardner from Washington.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/epa-chief-committed-restoring-scientific-integrity-76790178,business,AP Interview: EPA head removes Trump-era science advisers,"WASHINGTON -- In a move he said would help restore “scientific integrity,” the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency is removing dozens of scientists and other experts from key advisory boards named under President  , saying they were overly friendly to industry. EPA Administrator         Michael Regan, in an Associated Press interview, said the “reset” of the Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee will return EPA to its time-honored practice of relying on advice from a balanced group of experts. He is clearing out the two important panels, although current members can apply for reinstatement. “Scientific integrity is a foundational value for EPA,'' Regan said. “And I am committing to ensuring that every single decision we make meets rigorous scientific standards.’’ Restoring public confidence in the EPA is a top goal, Regan said. “And I think to do that, we have to identify and root out any decisions from the past that were not properly aligned with science,'' he said. Regan has repeatedly said “science is back."" He said that “is very true,"" but added that ""underpinning that is the importance of scientific integrity and transparency here at the agency. The actions we’re taking are indicative of how serious we are about repairing the scientific integrity at EPA.'' Regan, 44, was North Carolina’s top  al regulator for four years. At the EPA, he is helping to lead President Joe Biden’s efforts to address climate change and advocate for  al justice. Regan is the first Black man to run the EPA. The overhaul announced Wednesday ousts more than 40 members of the two science advisory boards, including some whose terms do not expire this year. Members can apply to keep serving, but must compete against other candidates. Regan will make final selections, expected within months. The panels provide scientific expertise and recommendations for air quality standards and other policies intended to protect public health and the environment. Democrats have said the decision by Donald Trump's first EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, to remove many academic scientists from the advisory panels tilted them in favor of the chemical and fossil fuel industries. Pruitt barred scientists from serving on the advisory boards if they had received EPA research grants. Pruitt later resigned amid ethics scandals but his policies were largely continued under his successor and former deputy, Andrew Wheeler. In a related development, Regan said the EPA will be part of a White House effort to investigate Trump-era political interference in science across the government. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a task force Monday aimed at identifying past tampering in scientific decisions. “Science is a big part of our mission, and my expectation is that we will be a part of that exercise,'' Regan said, calling the emphasis on scientific integrity a return to past practice rather than a new initiative. “Science was not in question prior to the previous administration. There were some norms, some structures and transparency that we are actually returning back.'' John Graham, a former George W. Bush administration official who had led the Science Advisory Board since last year, defended that panel’s work, saying in an email it “exposed the scientific shortcomings of the Trump EPA’s plans to weaken greenhouse gas standards for autos and remove numerous water bodies from federal pollution protection.″ Graham said he was saddened by Regan’s “radical action,'' which he said is “disrupting” every board member’s service and hampering the panel's work. Graham, a professor at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said he will not reapply “because I respectfully protest the entire process that Administrator Regan has concocted.'' Regan, in the AP interview, said his emphasis on scientific integrity also plays a major role in recruiting new and former employees as EPA attempts to rebuild after losing more than 10% of its workforce under Trump. “The people at EPA joined this agency for a specific reason. They believe in the mission. They believe in public service, and they want to protect public health and the environment,'' he said. “And so it's our job to make sure we have a work environment that promotes science, data, integrity and transparency. We’re going to have to walk that walk — demonstrate we are a worthy place of employment. I believe lots of people are already getting that message.″ On policy issues, Regan pledged to confront climate change, ensure environmental justice at communities near refineries and other hazardous sites and protect public health on issues such as a cluster of “forever chemicals” known as PFAS that are increasingly turning up in public drinking water systems, private wells and even food. A federal court’s recent decision to vacate the Trump administration’s replacement of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan gives Regan's team a “clean slate” to regulate coal-burning power plants that contribute to global warming, he said. Regan said he also is open to stricter air quality standards for ozone and other pollutants and will evaluate waivers offered by the Trump administration to relax a host of environmental rules during the coronavirus pandemic. Critics said the change allowed a “pandemic of pollution” in the past year. “Sometimes, ill-informed decisions that seem to be politically expedient end up not helping any parties,'' Regan said, referring to actions by Wheeler and Pruitt, his two immediate predecessors. Regan rejected criticism by some Republican senators that he will have less power than “unaccountable” White House officials, such as climate adviser Gina McCarthy, a former EPA chief, or climate envoy John Kerry, a former senator and secretary of state. “My job is prove that theory wrong, and it's my intent to do just that,'' he said, noting the EPA powers granted by Congress. “We set the agenda here, based on the president’s vision, and we are charged with protecting the public health and the environment,'' he said."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/microsoft-wins-22-billion-deal-making-headsets-us-76795452,business,Microsoft wins $22 billion deal making headsets for US Army,"Microsoft won a nearly $22 billion contract to         supply U.S. Army combat troops with its augmented reality headsets. Microsoft and the Army         separately announced the deal Wednesday. The technology is based on Microsoft's HoloLens headsets, which were originally intended for the video game and entertainment industries. Pentagon officials have described the futuristic technology — which the Army calls its Integrated Visual Augmentation System — as a way of boosting soldiers' awareness of their surroundings and their ability to spot targets and dangers. Microsoft’s head-mounted HoloLens displays let people see virtual imagery superimposed over the physical world in front of them — anything from holograms in virtual game worlds to repair instructions floating over a broken gadget. The Army's website says soldiers tested the gadgets last year at Fort Pickett in Virginia. It said the system could help troops gain an advantage “on battlefields that are increasingly urban, congested, dark and unpredictable.” The Army first began testing Microsoft's system with a $480 million contract in 2018 and said the headsets could be used for both training and in actual battle. The new contract will enable Microsoft to mass produce units for more than 120,000 soldiers in the Army Close Combat Force. Microsoft said the contract will amount to up to $21.88 billion over the next decade, with a five-year base agreement that can be extended for another five years. It's not clear how it corresponds to the $740 billion defense policy bill that Congress passed in January after overriding a veto by President Donald Trump. The bill affirmed a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops but included cuts to the headset initiative. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday that the technology is promising but its results must be closely tracked ""and it’s our job to raise issues if the technology isn’t meeting the needs of our troops now and in the future.” Microsoft President Brad Smith told Reed's committee in February that the system could integrate thermal night vision and facial recognition to provide soldiers with “real-time analytics” on remote battlefields. He also described how it could help in planning a hostage rescue operation by creating a “digital twin” of the building. A group of Microsoft workers in 2019 petitioned the company to cancel its initial Army deal, arguing it would turn real-world battlefields into a video game. Microsoft is among several tech companies that have sought to wow the gaming world with glitzy new virtual reality goggles over the past decade, though the efforts have largely fizzled. Microsoft pivoted away from consumer applications for its second-generation HoloLens 2, introduced in 2019, which is the basis for the Army's new gadgets. Although Microsoft recently demonstrated a way to use the goggles to play the hit game Pokemon Go, it mostly pitches the devices as work tools to help surgeons, factory crews and others. Users can often control what's on their screens using hand gestures or voice commands. The headset deal is part of Microsoft's broader work as a defense contractor. The Pentagon in September reaffirmed Microsoft as winner of a cloud computing contract potentially worth $10 billion, although the work has been delayed by a legal battle over rival Amazon’s claim that the bidding process was flawed."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/eager-build-infrastructure-biden-plans-tax-business-76784907,business,Biden announces huge infrastructure plan to 'win the future',"PITTSBURGH -- President   outlined a huge $2.3 trillion plan Wednesday to reengineer the nation’s infrastructure in what he billed as “a once-in-a-generation investment in America” that would undo his predecessor’s signature legislative achievement — giant tax cuts for corporations — in the process. Speaking at a carpenters union training center in Pittsburgh, Biden drew comparisons between his hard-hatted proposed transformation of the U.S. economy and the space race — and promised results as grand in scale as the New Deal or Great Society programs that shaped the 20th century. “It’s not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Biden said. ""It’s a once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it’s the largest American jobs investment since World War II. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs.” White House officials say the spending would generate those jobs as the country shifts away from fossil fuels and combats the perils of climate change. It is also an effort to compete with the technology and public investments made by China, which has the world’s second-largest economy and is fast gaining on the United States’ dominant position. “I’m convinced that if we act now, in 50 years people are going to look back and say this is the moment when America won the future,” Biden said. The Democratic president’s infrastructure projects would be financed by higher corporate taxes — a trade-off that could lead to         fierce resistance from the business community and thwart attempts to work with Republican lawmakers. Biden hopes to pass         an infrastructure plan by summer, which could mean relying solely on the slim Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. The higher corporate taxes would aim to raise the necessary piles of money over 15 years and then reduce the deficit going forward. In doing so, Biden would undo the 2017 tax overhaul by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans and lift the corporate tax rate to 28% from the 21% rate. “Ninety-one Fortune 500 Companies, including Amazon, pay not a single solitary penny in income tax,” Biden said. Wednesday's announcement will be followed in coming weeks by Biden pushing a companion bill of roughly equal size for investments in child care, family tax credits and other domestic programs. That nearly $2 trillion package would be paid for by tax hikes on wealthy individuals and families. “Wall Street didn’t build this country,"" Biden said. ""You, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class.” Biden's choice of Pittsburgh for unveiling the plan carried important economic and political resonance. He not only won Pittsburgh and its surrounding county to help secure the presidency, but he launched his campaign there in 2019. The city famed for steel mills that powered America’s industrial rise has steadily pivoted toward technology and health care, drawing in college graduates in a sign of how economies can change. The White House says the largest chunk of the proposal         includes $621 billion for roads, bridges, public transit, electric vehicle charging stations and other transportation infrastructure. The spending would push the country away from internal combustion engines that the auto industry views as increasingly antiquated technology. An additional $111 billion would go to replace lead water pipes and upgrade sewers. Broadband internet would blanket the country for $100 billion. Separately, $100 billion would upgrade the power grid to deliver clean electricity. Homes would get retrofitted, schools modernized, workers trained and hospitals renovated under the plan, which also seeks to strengthen U.S. manufacturing. The new construction could keep the economy running hot, coming on the heels of         Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.  Economists already estimate it could push growth above 6% this year. To keep companies from shifting profits overseas to avoid taxation, a 21% global minimum tax would be imposed. The tax code would also be updated so that companies could not merge with foreign businesses and avoid taxes by moving their headquarters to a tax haven. And among other provisions, it would increase IRS audits of corporations. Biden appealed for Republicans and the business community to join him in negotiations on the bill, but the legislative prospects for Biden's twin proposals already appear to hinge on Democrats coming up with the votes on their own through the budget reconciliation process, which requires just a simple majority in the 50-50 Senate. “I’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them, what they have to say and be open to other ideas,"" Biden said. ""We’ll have a good faith negotiation. Any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done.” Democratic leaders embraced Biden’s plan Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said it would create millions of jobs. “I look forward to working with President Biden to pass a big, bold plan that will drive America forward for decades to come,” Schumer said at an event in Buffalo. But Republican opposition to Biden’s ambitious proposal came swiftly, and with resolve for the long brawl ahead. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the package as nothing more than a “Trojan horse” for tax hikes. Republicans on Capitol Hill view the fight as a defining moment for the parties, framing it as a choice between Democrats intent on relying on government to solve the nation’s problems and a GOP that believes the private sector can best unleash the nation’s potential. Smarting over Biden’s intent to undo the 2017 tax cuts has only solidified what could amount to a wall of GOP opposition. The business community favors updating U.S. infrastructure but dislikes higher tax rates. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said in a statement that “we applaud the Biden administration for making infrastructure a top priority. However, we believe the proposal is dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure.” The Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs, would rather have infrastructure funded with user fees such as tolls. Trump, in a statement, blasted his successor’s proposal, claiming it “would be among the largest self-inflicted economic wounds in history.” Infrastructure spending usually holds the promise of juicing economic growth, but by how much remains a subject of political debate. Commutes and shipping times could be shortened, while public health would be improved and construction jobs would bolster consumer spending. Standard & Poor’s chief U.S. economist, Beth Ann Bovino, estimated last year that a $2.1 trillion boost in infrastructure spending could add as much as $5.7 trillion in income to the entire economy over a decade. Those kinds of analyses have led liberal Democrats in Congress such as Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal to conclude, “The economic consensus is that infrastructure pays for itself over time.” But the Biden administration is taking a more cautious approach than some Democrats might like. After $1.9 trillion in pandemic aid and $4 trillion in relief last year, the administration is trying to avoid raising the national debt to levels that would trigger higher interest rates and make it harder to repay. Biden’s efforts may also be complicated by demands from a handful of Democratic lawmakers who say they cannot support the bill unless it addresses the $10,000 cap on individuals' state and local tax deductions put in place under Trump and a Republican-led Congress. With a narrow majority in the House, those Democrats could conceivably quash any bill that doesn’t significantly lift the cap or repeal it entirely. ——— Miller and Freking reported from Washington.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bank-japan-survey-optimism-economic-recovery-76802155,business,Bank of Japan 'tankan' survey upbeat over economic recovery,"TOKYO -- A closely watched economic survey by the Bank of   shows growing optimism as the world’s third-largest economy grapples with the damage from the   pandemic. The quarterly “tankan” survey’s headline index for big manufacturers’ sentiment stood at plus 5 in March, a considerable improvement over the minus 10 marked in December, and more positive than the forecast at plus 4. The survey reported Thursday highlights a steady recovery in sentiment over the last three quarters, to levels before COVID-19 began in late 2019. The tankan measures corporate sentiment by subtracting the number of companies saying business conditions are negative from those responding they are positive. Sentiment among large nonmanufacturers improved by four points to minus 1, underlying how that sector is bouncing back far more slowly than big manufacturers. Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at SuMi TRUST, or Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, said he believes the recovery is slower in the service sector because of government-backed “states of emergency” issued periodically, with the latest ending in March. Exports have led the recovery, while the food, travel and accommodation sectors have stalled. But the overall impact will be gentler than last years’ because the latest emergency only applied to some parts of  , Oshikubo said in a report this week. “And, in general, people have become accustomed to COVID-19 measures,” he said. The coronavirus sent sentiment in Japan Inc. plunging last year to levels last seen when the economy was battered by the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Although trade and some economic activity have been recovering, income from tourism, a major driver for growth in recent years, is still squelched because of pandemic-related restrictions. Some 9,100 people have died from COVID-19 in Japan. The vaccine rollout has barely begun, with less than 1% of the population inoculated. Junichi Makino, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, noted the vaccine is key to ensuring a recovery in the nonmanufacturing sector, while profitability at major companies was likely to keep improving. “Consumer spending is critical for boosting domestic demand, and that's closely related to containing the coronavirus and progress of the vaccine rollout,” he said in comments on the tankan. With cases rising recently in a “fourth wave,”         worries are growing about the Tokyo Olympics, set to open in July, with tens of thousands of people, including athletes, business and government officials and media, entering the country from abroad. ——— Yuri Kageyama on Twitter         https://twitter.com/yurikageyama"

Market benchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney advanced. Japan's closely watched quarterly Tankan survey found business conditions improved more than expected. South Korea reported higher March export growth. House prices rose in New Zealand and Australian manufacturing expanded. “Asia-Pacific released a lot of data today, including Japan’s latest Tankan survey. Most of it was positive,” Robert Carnell of ING said in a report. Biden announced plans to spend on broadband internet and clean energy, roads, bridges and public transit. The plan would roll back corporate tax cuts enacted under his predecessor,  . There was little market reaction because “investors appear to have already priced in” the spending and  , said Edward Moya of Oanda in a report. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.3% to 3,453.10 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo advanced 1.1% to 29,513.59. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.8% to 28,616.61. The Kospi in Seoul was 0.5% higher at 3,075.97 while Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.3% to 6,814.20. New Zealand and Jakarta declined while Singapore advanced. Investors are swinging between optimism that coronavirus vaccines will allow business to return to normal and unease about rising infections in the United States and some European countries. That has prompted some to reimpose travel curbs. In Japan, the Tankan index of business conditions for large manufacturers rose into positive territory for the first time since 2019. That “supports our view that the economy’s recovery from the pandemic will gather pace again soon,” said Tom Learmouth of Capital Economics in a report.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pressure-ga-corporate-leaders-slam-voting-bill-76796793,business,"Under pressure, some Ga. corporate leaders slam voting bill","ATLANTA -- Some of Georgia's most prominent corporate leaders on Wednesday began to more forcefully criticize the state's         sweeping new election law, acknowledging         concerns of civil rights activists and Black business executives who say the measure targets non-white voters and threatens the democratic process. The chief executives of         Delta Air Lines and         Coca-Cola pivoted from earlier, more equivocal statements and called the law “unacceptable,"" opening an unusual rift with Republican leaders who championed the legislation and typically enjoy a cozy relationship with the state's business community. The business lobby in Georgia, home to 18 Fortune 500 companies, wields significant clout in state politics. Civil rights activists blamed influential executives for not helping spike the new law that's become a focal point in the nationwide, partisan fight over voting rights, and there is rising pressure nationally on corporate titans to defend voting rights more explicitly and oppose Republican efforts in states that could follow Georgia’s lead. Delta's and Coca-Cola's latest declarations could push Georgia's other marquee brands, including UPS and Home Depot, to take a stronger stand. “Delta’s statement finally tells the truth — even if it’s late,” said Nsé Ufot of the New Georgia Project, which has launched an ad campaign targeting major corporations. After Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the new law last week, Delta issued a statement promoting parts of the law such as expanded weekend voting, but said “we understand concerns remain over other provisions ... and there continues to be work ahead in this important effort.” Chief executive Ed Bastian was more blunt in a memo sent Wednesday to employees. “The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true,” Bastian wrote, alluding to former President Donald Trump’s false claims that he lost because of fraud. “Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.” Bastian said Delta “joined other major Atlanta corporations to work closely with elected officials from both parties, to try and remove some of the most egregious measures from the bill. We had some success in eliminating the most suppressive tactics that some had proposed.” But, he said, “I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values.” Speaking later on CNBC, Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey called the legislation a “step backward.” “It does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting, around voter convenience, about ensuring election integrity,” he said. ""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied.” Kemp insisted the law was being misrepresented. He accused businesses of ignoring their role in its development. “Throughout the legislative process, we spoke directly with Delta representatives numerous times,” the governor said in a statement. “Today’s statement ... stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists.” The reaction wasn’t much friendlier from voting rights groups that fought the legislation and criticized corporate players for not trying to block it altogether. Ufot chided Bastian for his timing and alluding to conversations “with leaders and employees in the Black community” late in the process. She also noted advocates' pending demands that Delta and other companies no longer use their political action committees to back lawmakers who support voting restrictions. Bastian’s memo did not address that matter. Quincey noted on CNBC that Coca-Cola, even before Georgia's action, already had paused its PAC activity and would consider politicians' position on voting rights as part of future contributions. Separately Wednesday, dozens of Black business executives from around the country, including Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier and former American Express chief executive Kenneth Chenault, released a joint letter in The New York Times urging corporate America to stand up forcefully on matters of racial justice. Black activists, meanwhile, recall that many U.S. corporations took public stands last summer amid nationwide demonstrations against systemic racism and police violence. Bishop Reginald Jackson, who presides over more than 400 African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia, said too many corporate leaders have been “silent” on voting laws. He has called for his 90,000 parishioners to boycott Delta, Coca-Cola and other major brands. “This is not just a Georgia issue or problem. It is a national problem that we believe puts our democracy at risk,” Jackson said. Business analysts say the dynamics are challenging for corporations. “Delta clearly felt a lot of heat for its previous statement. Delta’s problem now is credibility,” said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst in San Francisco. “Will people believe future Delta statements or actions regarding voting rights or social justice?” Kemp signed the measure last Thursday, hours after a negotiated version cleared the state House and Senate in whirlwind votes. It is part of a tide of GOP-sponsored election bills introduced in states across the country after Trump’s false assertions about the 2020 elections. Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential race in Georgia by about 12,000 votes out of almost 5 million cast, and Democrats won two Jan. 5 Senate runoffs to give the party control of the chamber on Capitol Hill. Georgia officials, including Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, also a Republican, vouched for election’s accuracy even as they backed some changes that could make it harder for Georgians to cast absentee ballots, a method that more than one-fifth of the November electorate used. The new law adds a photo ID requirement for voting absentee by mail, cuts the amount of time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed. It also bans people from handing out food or water to voters waiting in line and allows the Republican-controlled State Election Board to remove and replace county election officials while curtailing the power of the secretary of state as Georgia’s chief elections officer. Republicans insist the changes are needed to restore voters’ confidence. Civil rights groups have filed federal lawsuits seeking to overturn the Georgia law. They've otherwise turned their focus to Washington, where Democrats are pushing         a comprehensive federal overhaul of election law that could effectively override many changes being enacted in Georgia and considered elsewhere. Advocates want corporate leaders like Bastian and Quincey to help. “They’ve been out there trying to claim victory in Georgia, saying basically that this bill could have been worse,” said Mia Arreguin of Progress Georgia. “But this was never going to be a voter-friendly bill. Now they can really do something about it” in Washington. “We aren’t watching what they say. We are watching what they do.” Bastian nodded toward Capitol Hill action in his memo, declaring that federal proposals would “expand voting rights nationwide.” He noted one bill is “named after the late Atlanta civil rights hero and Delta friend John Lewis,” the longtime Georgia congressman who died last year. But Bastian stopped short of an explicit position. Delta, he wrote, is “closely monitoring legislation.”"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/analysis-bumpy-road-ahead-bidens-infrastructure-plan-76797885,business,Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Biden's infrastructure plan,"Infrastructure was a road to nowhere for former presidents   and  . But   believes he can use it to drive America to the future after a dozen years of false starts. The trip is unlikely to be smooth. Biden's         $2.3 trillion infrastructure package, released Wednesday, would go well beyond the usual commitments to roads and bridges to touch almost every part of the country. It's a down payment on combating climate change, a chance to take on racial inequities, an expansion of broadband, an investment in manufacturing and a reorienting of corporate   to pay for everything. To succeed where his predecessors stalled, Biden will have to navigate a conflicting set of political forces with winners and losers all around. “It’s big, yes, it’s bold, yes, and we can get it done,"" the president said in a Wednesday afternoon speech in Pittsburgh. “In 50 years, people are gonna look back and say, this was the moment that America won the future.” Biden sees infrastructure as a fundamental promise that must be honored before Democrats face voters in 2022. The president resisted calls by business groups to pay for his plan with higher gas   and tolls, since the costs would be borne by working Americans and Biden had promised no tax hikes on anyone making less than $400,000. That's according to an administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. Yet the decision to keep that particular promise likely dooms any chance of wider bipartisan unity. Biden's proposal would gut the core of Trump's 2017 tax cuts — an affront to many Republican lawmakers, who would also prefer that infrastructure stay in a narrow lane. The corporate tax rate would jump to 28% from 21% under Biden's plan, and a global minimum tax would be charged to prevent companies from avoiding taxes. Even before Biden delivered his opening speech on the plan, Republicans had latched on to Reagan-era labeling, dismissing the package as tax-and-spend liberalism. That's an attack designed to erode public support as different components of the package get divvied up among congressional committees and begin their journey through Congress. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called the plan a “Trojan horse” for tax hikes. Trump issued a statement saying the big winner would be China because U.S. jobs would move overseas due to higher taxes. “It is the exact OPPOSITE of putting America First—it is putting America LAST!” said Trump, whose own repeated attempts at an “infrastructure week” failed to capture political momentum and became something of a punchline. Some Democratic lawmakers, on the other hand, fear Biden's plan does too little over eight years. Others see it as a chance to tinker by repealing the $10,000 taxpayer limit on deducting state and local taxes, or SALT, that was instituted under Trump. Each possible Democratic defection matters because vacant seats leave House Democrats with the thinnest of majorities. And in the evenly split Senate, Democrats must rely on Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote for their edge. “I can only vote for a bill that has meaningful tax impact for my constituents if it addresses the SALT cap,” tweeted Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., one of four lawmakers demanding to expand deductions. Some environmentalists, meanwhile, say the plan doesn't do enough to stop the tides of climate change, even with its proposed upgrades to the power grid and plans to build 500,000 electric-vehicle charging stations. They could push Biden to go even bigger, though he plans to announce a second package in the coming weeks focused on child care, family tax credits and other domestic programs, paid for by tax hikes on wealthy individuals and families. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the near-100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus, said climate change demands that Biden commit to more money. “It makes little sense to narrow his previous ambition on infrastructure or compromise with the physical realities of climate change,” she said. Almost every trade group in Washington representing interests from semiconductors to steel has a stake in the infrastructure bill, as does organized labor, which sees the potential for union jobs. Business groups have long backed bold investment in infrastructure — just not through taxes on their members. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable both strongly oppose the tax hikes. White House officials welcome the coming debate as a way to press their case, using the same kind of strategy that Biden deployed with his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief that became law in March. If tax hikes are opposed, how should the infrastructure be financed? What are lawmakers' counteroffers? The difference in this proposal, compared to coronavirus relief, is that infrastructure is not an emergency that can be funded through debt with minimal tradeoffs. Instead, congressional committees can break up its details and consider each of them separately, possibly peeling off elements like highway or water infrastructure that have some bipartisan support. In fact, past failures mean that many of the ideas being proposed have circulated among lawmakers for decades. But failure by political leaders this time could be devastating for America's economic trajectory. Once the economy bounces back from the pandemic, economists expect growth to fade below the relatively sluggish levels of the Obama and Trump eras. Infrastructure is a central way to increase worker productivity, the ultimate source of wealth and productivity. “It’s the first time that I see a comprehensive plan that truly can have a fundamental change in American productivity,” said Sadek Wahba, founder of the infrastructure investment firm I Squared Capital. “This is really the moment. If we’re not able to do it now, I would be very, very pessimistic about our ability to maintain our productivity over the coming decade.” ——— EDITOR’S NOTE: Josh Boak has covered the U.S. economy and the White House for The Associated Press for seven years. ——— Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Kevin Freking contributed to this analysis."
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/company-heart-jj-vaccine-woes-series-citations-76803905,business,Company at heart of J&J vaccine woes has series of citations,"The company at the center of quality problems that led Johnson & Johnson to discard an unknown amount of its coronavirus vaccine has a string of citations from U.S. health officials for quality control problems. Emergent BioSolutons, a little-known company at the center of the vaccine supply chain, was a key to Johnson & Johnson's plan to deliver 100 million doses of its vaccine to the U.S. by the end of May. But the company has been cited repeatedly by the Food and Drug Administration for problems such as poorly trained employees, cracked vials and mold around one of its facilities, according to records obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. The records cover inspections at Emergent facilities since 2017. Johnson & Johnson said Wednesday that a batch of vaccine made by Emergent at its Baltimore factory, known as Bayview, can't be used because it didn't meet quality standards. It wasn't clear exactly how many doses were involved or how the problem would affect future delivers of J&J's vaccine. The company said in a statement it was still planning to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June and was “aiming to deliver those doses by the end of May.” J&J locked arms with Emergent in April 2020, enlisting the lesser-known company to manufacture the vaccine J&J was developing with federal funding. At the time, Emergent’s Bayview facility wasn’t scaled for making millions of doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, according to the FDA records that describe the plant as a contract testing laboratory that “did not manufacture products for distribution.” Upgrades in technology and personnel were required before Bayview could begin making what’s known as “drug substance” material for the vaccine, a two-month process during which the required biological cells are grown. The FDA inspected Emergent’s Bayview plant in April 2020, just as the agreement with J&J was being announced. The federal agency criticized the company for problems with its testing of a potential treatment for anthrax, according to the records obtained by the AP. The FDA’s lead investigator cited the company for failing to train employees “in the particular operations they perform as part of their function and current good manufacturing practices.” On the same day, Johnson & Johnson, in a separate news release, heralded its partnership with Emergent as a step toward the pharmaceutical giant’s goal of supplying more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally by the end of 2021. Other problems cited by the FDA during the April 2020 inspection included failures by the Bayview plant “to ensure that electronically held data generated during analytical testing” of material “was protected from deletion or manipulation.” The FDA’s lead investigator, Marcellinus Dordunoo, wrote that Emergent hadn’t investigated what he described as “data integrity concerns.” The inspection was the most recent in a series of critical reports from the FDA about Emergent, including one following a December 2017 inspection at a plant in Canton, Massachusetts, in which the FDA said the company hadn’t corrected “continued low level mold and yeast isolates” found in the facility. Nearly a year later, agency investigators questioned why Emergent had “an unwritten policy of not conducting routine compliance audits” at a separate plant in Baltimore, known as Camden, where an anthrax vaccine is filled into vials. Emergent’s revenues skyrocketed during the Trump administration, jumping from around $523 million in 2015 to more than $1.5 billion in 2020. The company has invested heavily in lobbying the federal government, according to disclosure records, which show the company spent $3.6 million on lobbying in 2020 alone. Emergent is one of about 10 companies that Johnson & Johnson is using to speed up manufacturing of its recently approved vaccine, the company said. The Bayview factory where the tainted vaccine ingredient was found had not yet been approved by the FDA, so no vaccine in circulation is affected. Emergent declined to comment. President Joe Biden has pledged to have enough vaccines for all U.S. adults by the end of May. The U.S. government has ordered enough two-dose shots from Pfizer and Moderna to vaccinate 200 million people to be delivered by late May, plus the 100 million single-dose shots from J&J. A federal official said Wednesday evening the administration’s goal can be met without additional J&J doses. A J&J spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the company met the end-of-March goal, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s online vaccine tracker showed J&J had provided about 6.8 million doses to the U.S. vaccine effort. J&J has been shipping finished vaccines from its factory in the Netherlands to the U.S. J&J said it was putting more of its manufacturing and quality experts inside Emergent’s factory to supervise production of the COVID-19 vaccine, a move meant to enable delivery of an additional 24 million vaccine doses through April. J&J said it still expects to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. The J&J vaccine has been viewed as crucial for vaccination campaigns around the world, because only one shot is required and it can be shipped and stored at standard refrigeration temperatures, unlike some other vials that must be kept frozen. The company also has pledged to sell the vaccine without a profit, but only during the pandemic emergency. The problem with the vaccine batch was first reported by The New York Times. The FDA said it was aware of the situation but declined further comment. ——— Johnson reported from Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, and Lardner from Washington.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bends-blockbuster-popular-netflix-show-76774655,business,World's last Blockbuster more popular after Netflix show,"BEND, Ore. -- The Blockbuster video rental store in Bend, Oregon, soared to international fame when it became the last such franchise on Earth two years ago. Now, a new Netflix documentary called “The Last Blockbuster” brought even more interest in the form of visitors, mail and online orders to the unassuming location in a central Oregon strip mall 170 miles east of Portland. Since the documentary aired March 15, people from all over the world have sent flowers and called the store just to say “thank you” for staying open. In the backroom, staff members have been busy packaging thousands of online orders for Blockbuster T-shirts, hats and face masks, which are all made by Bend businesses. The movie focuses on the manager’s day-to-day work running the store,         which became the last in the world when the Blockbuster in Perth, Australia, closed two years ago. It was made by two local filmmakers who saw history and nostalgia in the store's perseverance. “It’s a little bit crazy, but it’s a very good thing,” store manager Sandi Harding         told The Bulletin in Bend. “We’ll take a little crazy if it means keeping the store open.” Harding is the star of the movie, which peaked as high as the No. 4 movie in the United States since it appeared on Netflix March 15. The Blockbuster video rental store in Bend was already popular when it became the last location on Earth. It drew visitors from across the United States and as far as Taiwan and London. “It’s good for the store. It’s good for the community,” said Harding, who has been stopped in the grocery store by fans who want to take her picture. “And I can learn to live with my newfound fame as long as it doesn’t mess with what we are doing every day.” The two Bend filmmakers behind the documentary, Taylor Morden and Zeke Kamm, had no idea if the store would stay open when they started filming in 2017. Morden said he has heard from people who call Harding a national treasure and say the store must remain open at all costs. He is pleased to know the film’s attention on Netflix may be what keeps the store open. “For us to have some small part in helping the store stay open is amazing,” Morden said. “Not a lot of documentaries actually accomplish the goal of their story.” The Bend Blockbuster has no plans to close. It has a steady lease agreement, and the local owners, Ken and Debbie Tisher, have leased the property since 1992, when it was a Pacific Video store. The store was franchised in 2000 and became a Blockbuster. In its heyday, Blockbuster Video had 9,000 stores around the world. But in-store video rental stores began struggling with the rise in on-demand streaming services such as Netflix — the very streaming service now offering the Blockbuster documentary. In 2010, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy, and by 2014, all corporate-owned stores had shuttered. That left locally owned franchises like the one in Bend to fend for themselves, and one by one, they closed. When stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, shut down in 2018 — barely outlasting a Redmond, Oregon, store — Bend’s Blockbuster was the only U.S. location left. Then, in 2019, the only other Blockbuster in Perth, Australia, shut its doors, leaving Bend as the last store. The movie also reveals that Blockbuster had an option to buy Netflix years ago, when the company was still a mail-order DVD service and hadn't transformed into the dominant streaming service it is now. The video empire's leadership, however, saw Netflix as a niche market with limited potential and declined to buy it, according to the documentary and previous news reports. But beyond the business details, the movie taps into the nostalgia felt by people of a certain age as the world speeds up and personal interactions become less frequent, the filmmakers said. Many watching it recall working in Blockbuster stores themselves or renting from them often in their younger years. “It’s affected people emotionally,” Kamm said. “I think it reminded people that we had this thing that was such an important part of our lives. Hopefully it reminds people to appreciate the things they have now.” Both filmmakers feel connected with the Bend Blockbuster, even though they are done filming their movie. They contact Harding regularly to find out if she needs more DVDs of their movies or movie posters to sell at the store. “I’m sure I’ll be involved with the folks at the last Blockbuster until they ever close,” Morden said. “There is no way we are not going to be connected.”"
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/chinas-huawei-2020-sales-rose-us-sanctions-76784413,business,China's Huawei says 2020 sales rose despite US sanctions,"BEIJING -- Chinese tech giant Huawei said Wednesday it eked out higher sales and profit last year but growth plunged after its smartphone unit was hammered by U.S. sanctions imposed in a fight with Beijing over technology and security. China’s first global tech brand reported sales of phones, network gear and other technology rose 3.8% over 2019 to 891.4 billion yuan ($135.8 billion), a decline from the previous year’s 19.1% growth. That was propelled by a 15.4% gain in China, while sales in other markets shrank. Huawei Technologies Ltd. is struggling to keep its global markets after then-President   in 2019 cut off access to U.S. processor chips and other technology. Huawei was the top-selling smartphone brand in the second quarter of 2020 but fell out of the global top five after losing Google's music and other popular services. “We think this is a very unfair situation to Huawei. It has damaged us a lot,” chairman Ken Hu said at a news conference at Huawei headquarters in the southern city of Shenzhen. The results reflect the damage from sanctions and point to a possible future for Huawei that focuses on China and on networks and other products that are less vulnerable to foreign pressure. Huawei, which denies accusations it might aid Chinese spying, sold its lower-priced Honor smartphone brand in hopes of reviving sales by separating it from the sanctions on the parent company. Huawei says it has a stockpile of U.S. chips for its high-end smartphones but executives have said those are running out. Trump expanded sanctions by barring global suppliers last year from using U.S. technology to produce chips for Huawei. Economists and political analysts expect little change under President Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump in January. The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, said in February he sees little chance that sanctions will be lifted. Hu didn’t respond directly when asked how Huawei would cope if sanctions remain and when China’s fledgling tech industry might supply the advanced chips it needs. But he said U.S. suppliers have lost $10-20 billion in annual sales to Huawei and expressed hope for unspecified “help from national leaders around the world” to restore interaction with global chip suppliers. “We hope they can help us to restore this kind of cooperation in the semiconductor industry,” he said. Hu expressed confidence global sales will rebound once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control. “I’m pretty positive about 2021 performance in regions outside China, but I’m not able to give you a definitive forecast,"" he said. The clash with Washington prompted the ruling Communist Party to make transforming China into a self-reliant “technology power” this year's top economic priority. The Finance Ministry announced this week chipmakers will be exempt from import taxes on equipment and raw materials through 2030. Huawei said 2020 profit edged up 3.2% to 64.6 billion yuan ($9.8 billion), decelerating from 2019’s 5.6% growth. Sales growth was the weakest since a one-year contraction in the early 2000s after the tech industry was shaken by the collapse of share prices for internet companies on Wall Street, according to the company. Sales of smartphones and other consumer products rose 3.3% over 2019 to 487 billion yuan ($74.1 billion), or 54% of total revenue. That was down from a 34% increase in 2019. In a show of technical prowess, the company unveiled a folding smartphone in February with an eight-inch-wide (20-centimeter-wide) screen. But it said the Mate X2 will be sold only in China, possibly reflecting shortages of processor chips to manufacture it. Research and development spending, already among the highest for any company, rose to 141.9 billion yuan ($21.6 billion), according to Huawei. That was 16% of revenue, up from about 10% in previous years. Sales in 2020 were hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. The 15.4% sales growth was less than half of 2019’s 36.2%. Network equipment sales to global phone carriers were flat at 302.6 billion yuan ($46.4 billion) after Washington pressured European and other allies to exclude Huawei as they upgrade to next-generation technology. Chinese officials accuse Washington of using phony security accusations to hurt a rising competitor. The two governments, along with Canada, are fighting over the arrest in Vancouver of a Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, who is Ren’s daughter. She is fighting extradition to the United States on charges related to possible violation of U.S. trade sanctions on Iran. Two former Canadian diplomats were arrested in China and are being prosecuted on spying charges in what is widely seen as an attempt to pressure Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to release Meng. As more people worked remotely, technology sales to manufacturers, health care and other businesses jumped 23% in 2020 to 103.4 billion yuan ($15.4 billion), up from 2019’s 8.6% gain. Huawei says it is owned by the Chinese employees who make up half its workforce of 197,000 in 170 countries. The company began reporting financial results a decade ago in an attempt to defuse Western security concerns. ——— Huawei Technologies Ltd.: www.huawei.com"

Typically held at the vast conference space of Madinat Jumeirah in the shadow of Dubai's iconic, sail-shaped Burj al-Arab hotel, the 2021 event instead came to Dubai International Financial Center. Temporary galleries sprung up around the center's Gate House, the landmark structure at the business hub. Signs of the pandemic are still everywhere: Social-distancing signs and hand sanitizer dispensers stand visible in the tents housing the galleries. People attending the fair can book a specific time slot in advance to guarantee their entry. Those worried about being around a crowd can take a virtual tour of the fair from home. Even some of the art is teleconferencing into the event. Art Dubai introduced a program allowing galleries unable to travel to Dubai to connect to visitors via video. The fair features 50 contemporary and modern galleries from 31 countries, specializing in regions that are not main players on the international art scene. It also focuses on artists from the Middle East. One of them is Rashed al-Shashai, a prominent figure of the contemporary Saudi art scene. He recently designed a piece entitled Concise Passage, 2020 in the kingdom's al-Ula historical district — a feature made of shipping crates divided by a pink-lighted walkway symbolizing a region that was once a key stop on an incense trade route linking Arabia to Asia. “Taking part in this fair shows the determination of art to be part of bringing life back to normal, for people and humanity,"" al-Shashai said. ""It helps people live in a better way, even when there are disasters and tragedies happening in the world.” As Dubai went into a lockdown in early 2020, the city's big events shut down, along with its long-haul carrier Emirates.         The autocratically ruled emirate moved aggressively to reopen in July to tourists. Coronavirus numbers however         spiked to levels unseen following New Year's Eve.  Other countries also blamed         Dubai for outbreaks of coronavirus variants. Since then, reported daily new infection numbers have dropped to over 2,000, from highs of nearly 4,000 at the worst of the winter. The United Arab Emirates is vaccinating at one of the quickest rates in the world, hoping to be ready for         Dubai hosting its Expo 2020 world's fair in October, after the pandemic forced a delay of the event last year. With airlines flying again, big events back on the calendar, and bars and restaurants open to residents and tourists — albeit masked when not eating or drinking — the UAE hopes to power through the rest of the pandemic. “Corona changed life as a whole,"" al-Shashai said. “I found that people are just waiting for a chance to come back, and they will, and they will rebuild, and they will forget everything that happened, and it will all become tales to be told.” The pandemic also featured in the art exhibited in the show. One piece, a giant outdoor display reading “NEWS: IT WON'T BE LIKE THIS FOREVER” drew many a selfie. “I think that culture is something that should never be canceled and I think it doesn’t matter the times that you’re going through,"" del Val said. “I think it’s a way that we can really interrelate with each other and where our senses and our positiveness come back to life."" “I think that one of the magics that Art Dubai is managing this week is precisely that ... bringing people (into) a completely different state of mind,” he added.

He was 58. The former prime minister's family and his governing Socialist party said Fino died Monday in a hospital, where he had been treated for several days after contracting COVID-19. The government declared Monday a day of national mourning, with flags flying at half-staff. Fino was a trained economist and former mayor of Gjirokastra, 230 kilometers (140 miles) south of the capital, Tirana. He was appointed in 1997 by Albania's president to lead a government of national unity. The country was on the brink of total anarchy following the collapse of widespread and wildly popular pyramid investment schemes, in which very many Albanians lost their life savings. Fino served for five months until early  s were held which brought the Socialists to power. He was credited with restoring normality in a country where central and local government structures had collapsed in the face of the protests, during which civilians entered army depots and looted vast quantities of arms. About 3,000 people died in the ensuing violence. “Mr. Fino will be remembered for his leadership, at a very young age, of Albania’s National Reconciliation Government during the difficult year 1997, as well as for his contributions to the lawmaking process during his extensive political career,” the U.S. Embassy in Tirana said in a statement. Prime Minister Edi Rama, who heads the Socialists, said he was temporarily suspending his party’s campaign activities before a national   scheduled for April 25. Lulzim Basha, leader of the main opposition center-right Democratic Party, also canceled his daily electoral activities. Fino held several other government positions and was a serving lawmaker with the Socialists until his death. He is survived by his wife, a daughter and a son."

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/transgender-tech-visibility-obstacles-remain/story?id=76374628,business,Transgender in tech: More visibility but obstacles remain ,"Ginger Chien said she was a ""techie"" from a young age. ""I was given all of the opportunities typically afforded to boys,"" she recalled. ""I was given freedom to be loud, and to attract attention. And given all of the technology toys as well -- Legos, Tinker toys, Erector sets."" Born in 1962 to Chinese immigrants, Chien's childhood seemed typical of a future engineer. She's been an engineer for decades, working as a device architect for   for the last 25 years. She's also part of the   working in the tech and engineering industries. Additionally, Chien is an advocate for trans rights. Exact statistics on trans people in tech are virtually nonexistent. Trans people face concerns over their safety, security and often, their very lives, by coming out. But there is a vibrant, engaged and increasingly vocal trans community made up of engineers, software developers, user interface designers and other tech professionals. Silicon Valley has focused on diversity and inclusion in recent years. There's an effort to get more women, people of color and LGBTQ+ people in tech and engineering. But as more trans people in tech come out in their workplaces, some say far more needs to be done to make them feel safe and supported at work. Chien said though she knew from an early age her choice of profession would be a technical one, she had questions ""very early"" surrounding her identity. ""I do recall that at a very early age I was asking for toys and friends and clothes ... to play with some of the girls in the neighborhood,"" she said. With those questions, came anxiety. As the only American-born son in her family, she said that in Chinese culture, ""there are certain expectations of sons."" ""I did not feel safe uncovering my gender identity. In fact, in early years it didn't even have a name. There was no way for me to even express the idea that I might want to be a girl because there were no words for it other than words that convey mental illness and illegal behavior,"" she said. That led to many years of living a ""submarined"" life, Chien said. She found success as an engineer, working right out of college for a defense contractor, but living an inauthentic life took a toll. ""I was afraid of losing the marriage that I had and the daughter that we had and my professional reputation once my career was established,"" she said. ""There was always something to worry about,"" Chien said. She said she became ""unhappy, sullen and unproductive"" at work. It took a long process of discovery and constantly weighing risks before Chien said she could embrace her identity as a woman. Also helping her, she said, was finding a new job with AT&T and discovering the company had a long-established LGBTQ employee resource group. In addition to the tech industry, finding accurate population totals on trans individuals overall in society is difficult. Violence and stigma against trans people make many of them wary about coming out in public. Adding to anti-trans sentiment, state legislators have filed a record number of bills this year that would impact the  , according to the Human Rights Campaign. The University of California, Los Angeles School of Law's Williams Institute, which studies sexual orientation, gender identity law and public policy   in the U.S. identify as transgender -- about 0.6% of the population. Workplace numbers are even scarcer but some tech companies, including   and   have publicly shared data on LGBTQ+ representation within their companies. And when Glassdoor -- an employment website -- posted the 24   for in 2020, 50% were tech companies, including Intuit, Uber, Google, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Accenture, HP, Salesforce, AT&T and Apple. Some of these companies are also on other LGBTQ-friendly work lists, including the  . And there are also growing numbers of organizations and online spaces for trans people in tech.    and   hold events and offer resources for trans, nonbinary and queer people in technology. Some trans and nonbinary people are also using their tech skills to make a career out of activism. Emma Best is a queer and nonbinary journalist, ""leakivist,"" publisher and sometimes analyst. As a ""leakivist,"" Best uses their tech prowess as a form of activism and has made leaked data accessible to media and other journalists. Best said anonymity makes it easier for trans people and gender nonconforming individuals to ""get their foot in the door"" in the tech space, especially with ""the prevalence of remote working."" But, Best said, more trans, queer and nonbinary people are also more active in tech because they are being more visible and ""refusing to yield their space."" Chien also offered reasons why more trans people may be more comfortable working in technology. ""Tech is a place where your performance is really easy to quantify,"" she said. ""I think it creates room for people who may be different in some way, but are also able to apply some of those arcane skills to ... tech."" ""I think that people in the tech industry tend to have sometimes more eclectic backgrounds ... there's a lot of different types of people coming together,"" Eli, 26, who asked their last name withheld for privacy reasons, told ABC News. Eli worked for several years in Apple retail. Despite greater visibility and more activism, everyday workplace resources for trans people are critical, said Max Masure, a trans nonbinary inclusion strategist. Masure worked for years as a user experience designer, but now consults with companies on how to foster inclusive environments for transgender people. ""I was born as a girl, and I lived my life as a woman for 36 years. And I only came out four years ago,"" Masure, who was born in France, told ABC News. ""I didn't see any trans people around me, the only ones were in the media ... mostly trans women, and they were made fun of,"" Masure said. It wasn't until Masure came to New York to work in tech that they said they had more visibility into queer and nonbinary people and culture. Masure became more empowered to embrace their authentic self, albeit with some consequences. ""I was working in tech at the time, and I had to advocate for myself, and I lost some clients being a freelancer,"" Masure said. That ""led me to realize there was a need for the tech community to train around inclusion. ... [The] usage of pronouns and putting them into our names in email signatures, on LinkedIn, is helping not only the trans community, but also everyone to be more inclusive,"" said Masure. For the last three years, Masure has switched from designing to training companies on trans and gender inclusion. The service is much-needed as even the most well-intentioned companies can make missteps. ""I recognized that I was trans a couple years into working for Apple. And then I came out while I was there and started to medically and socially transition,"" Eli said. While Eli said they didn't ""hide anything"" about their gender while working at Apple, they also said they didn't feel the need to explicitly disclose their identity. In fact, Eli wanted to take a more low-key approach in telling their co-workers how they identified and how they wanted to be addressed. ""I wanted to just come out through email,"" Eli said. Instead, Eli said they had to ""write up something that either I could tell people face to face ... individually or in a group. Or I was told the managers could do that. So it ended up being that one of the managers came out to people in small groups for me, which was not really my ideal way of doing it."" Situations like the one Eli described underscore the need for workplaces to do more to support trans people, advocates like Chien and Masure said. Supportive action could be as simple as asking employees to share their preferred pronouns. Eli said eventually employees started wearing nametags with their preferred pronouns at the Apple store where they worked. Even the way businesses handle internal forms can make a difference. Chien recalled her relief when she submitted a name-change form to AT&T's HR department. The form offered employees the option to select ""personal choice"" as a reason for a name change request -- meaning they did not have to disclose information they may feel uncomfortable sharing. For Chien, that option on the form meant a ""complete shift of agency of who has the right to decide my future and my identity."" Health care options to support trans people are also critical ways companies can help. ""Having health insurance that covers gender-affirming procedures is just something that is so hard to find,"" Eli said. For the trans community, insurance that covers ""big procedures, like bottom surgeries and top surgeries,"" is needed, Eli said. ""But ... there's other procedures, like facial surgeries, that are not covered as often that are very important ... in terms of safety out in public for people, especially trans feminine people and trans women,"" said Eli. For Masure, a key component for inclusion is active support from a business' leadership. ""What I see the most is the lack of leadership involvement,"" Masure said. ""I see people working in companies where they are not respected ... their pronouns are not respected ... jokes are made during regular meetings."" Masure said that leaders have to set examples by being examples of inclusivity. As trans people, ""we cannot only be the ones educating other people,"" Masure said. ""It gets exhausting."" Trans advocates urge cisgender people to go beyond being allies and become advocates. That could mean asking a company to create gender nonspecific bathrooms or speaking up when a trans person is misgendered or harassed in any way. ""The outside world can feel like a really dangerous place, especially today with anti-trans and anti-Asian"" violence and threats, Chien said, referring to the recent spate of  She said speaking out and advocating are important ways to create supportive workplaces for trans people. ""In the absence of language, there's an absence of possibility,"" Chien said."

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mexico-legislature-oks-legal-recreational-marijuana-76803340,business,New Mexico primed to join US recreational pot wave,"SANTA FE, N.M -- New Mexico is joining a wave of states that are legalizing recreational   as its Democrat-dominated Legislature sent a package of cannabis bills Wednesday to a supportive governor. Lawmakers used a marathon two-day legislative session to push through   legalization for adults over 21 and a companion bill that automatically erases many past marijuana convictions, overriding skeptical Republicans. By signing the bills, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham would extend legal recreational pot sales in the American Southwest by April 2022, when the New Mexico legislation kicks in, and join 16 states that have legalized marijuana, mostly through direct ballot initiatives. California and Colorado were among the first in the U.S. to legalize marijuana,         with Arizona becoming one of the latest in the region to follow suit earlier this year. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a legalization bill Wednesday, and a proposal in Virginia is awaiting the governor’s signature. The New Mexico initiative would reconsider criminal drug sentences for about 100 prisoners, and give the governor a strong hand in licensing the industry and monitoring supplies. New Mexico flirted with cannabis legalization in the 1990s, when then-Gov. Gary Johnson challenged taboos against decriminalization in defiance of Republican allies. The state's medical marijuana program founded in 2007 has attracted more than 100,000 patients. The Legislature was reticent to legalize until now. Several hardline opponents of legalization in the state Senate were voted out of office by Democrats in 2020 primary elections, in a shift that paved the way for Wednesday’s historic vote. Under the advancing legalization package, New Mexico would levy an initial excise tax on recreational marijuana sales of 12% that eventually rises to 18%. That’s on top of current gross receipts on sales that range from roughly 5% to 9%. Possession of up to 2 ounces (57 grams) of marijuana would cease to be a crime, and people would be allowed six plants at home — or up to 12 per household. The reforms would eliminate taxes on the sales of medical marijuana and seek to ensure adequate medicinal supplies. “The United States of America is in the midst of a sea change when it comes to this,” said Democratic state Rep. Javier Martinez of Albuquerque, lead sponsor of the legalization bill. “This bill begins to repair the harms of prohibition.” State oversight would largely fall to the governor-appointed superintendent of the Regulation and Licensing Department that would issue licenses for a fee to marijuana-related businesses. The agency initially would have the authority to limit marijuana production levels by major producers — a lever over market supplies and pricing. Several senators warned against the production cap as a recipe for creating a government sanctioned monopoly, amid lobbying for price supports by some incumbent medical marijuana producers. The legalization bill creates a cannabis control division to oversee 10 types of industry licenses. Those include micro-licenses with low annual fees for small producers to grow up to 200 marijuana plants and also package and sell their products. Bill sponsor Martinez says that provides an important measure of equity, within a bill designed to support communities that suffered from criminalization of marijuana and tough policing. Past drug convictions don’t automatically disqualify applicants for marijuana business licenses. The odor of marijuana or suspicion of possession are no longer legal grounds to stop, detain or search people. Legalization bill co-sponsor Rep. Deborah Armstrong says New Mexico will respond to early pitfalls of legalization in other states as it mandates child-proof packaging for marijuana products. Public health advocates condemned provisions that allow public consumption lounges for recreational cannabis, citing the dangers of second-hand smoke and vapor to workers and patrons. Lawmakers discarded a Republican-sponsored bill from Sen. Cliff Pirtle of Roswell that emphasized low taxes in an effort to stamp out illicit weed and would have provided low-cost licenses to small pot farmers by linking fees to the number of plants in cultivation. Local governments cannot prohibit pot businesses but can regulate locations and hours of operation, under the proposal. Bill sponsors say that sheriffs and police want consistency from town-to-town on rules and enforcement. Republican state Sen. Gay Kernan of Hobbs voted against legalization and said she was amazed that legislative colleagues would support the freedom to buy mind-altering drugs amid New Mexico's struggles with poverty and opioid overdoses. “I just think it’s terribly unfair to impose this kind of significant change in our way of life and areas of the state that clearly do not welcome this,"" Kernan said. ——— Attanasio is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

""Amazon is such a huge player in the economy, and the tech sector hasn't been one that the union movement has much representation in at all,"" Alex Colvin, the dean of Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told ABC News Tuesday. ""It could be a real shift if we started to see organizing at Amazon."" Colvin said a union formation in Alabama could set a ""precedent"" and inspire other Amazon workers across the country to follow suit. ""Amazon has a lot of facilities around the country and a lot of employees,"" he added. ""If this is the start of a broader movement towards unionization at Amazon, that would be a big deal to the economy."" The National Labor Relations Board began tabulating the votes from some 5,800 workers at the Bessemer Amazon facility on Tuesday, though it is not immediately clear when the results for the vote are expected to come in. If successful, the warehouse workers will be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). ""This campaign has already been a victory in many ways,"" RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement. ""Even though we don't know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country; and we have exposed the lengths to which employers will go to crush their employees trying to gain a union voice -- this campaign has become the prime example for why we need labor law reform in this country."" Colvin told ABC News that regardless of the way the vote turns out, ""We should anticipate a certain likelihood of an extended period of conflict over establishing collective bargaining at the workplace, we commonly see that after elections."" The Alabama workers' unionizing efforts have drawn support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Last week, Sen.  , I-Vt., visited Alabama to meet with some of the workers involved in the unionizing efforts. ""All I want to know is why the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, is spending millions trying to prevent workers from organizing a union so they can negotiate for better wages, benefits and working conditions,"" Sanders tweeted ahead of his visit. His tweet drew ire from Amazon executive Dave Clark, who responded to Sander's tweet by noting that Vermont's minimum wage is $11.75 an hour compared to Amazon's $15, adding, ""The Sen should save his finger wagging lecture until after he actually delivers in his own backyard."" On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has also publicly thrown his support behind the union in an   earlier this month. On the day voting began for the union,   on Twitter voicing his support for labor unions and encouraging workers to ""make your voice heard."" In response to a request for comment on the vote count commencing, Amazon told ABC News in a statement Tuesday that, ""RWDSU membership has fallen 25% during Stuart Appelbaum's tenure, but that's no justification for Mr. Appelbaum to misrepresent the facts."" The statement continued: ""Our employees know the truth -- starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encouraged all of our employees to vote, and their voices will be heard in the days ahead."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/victims-anti-asian-attacks-reflect-year-pandemic-76196503,lifestyle,"As virus-era attacks on Asians rise, past victims look back","Nearly a year after they were almost stabbed to death inside a Midland, Texas, Sam's Club, Bawi Cung and his two sons all have visible scars. It's the unseen ones though that are harder to get over. Cung can’t walk through any store without constantly looking in all directions. His 6-year-old son, who now can't move one eyebrow, is afraid to sleep alone. On a Saturday evening in March, when COVID-19 panic shopping gripped the nation, Cung was in search of rice at a cheaper price. The family was in the Sam's Club meat section when Cung suddenly felt a punch to the back of his head. A man he didn't know then slashed his face with a knife. The assailant left but soon returned to stab the boys. He wounded the 3-year-old in the back and slashed the 6-year-old from his right eye to a couple of inches past his right ear. The grisly encounter brought home the dangerous climate Asian Americans have faced since the   entered the U.S., with racially motivated harassment and assaults occurring from coast to coast. Now, just over a year and thousands of incidents later, some of the early victims find moving forward has been difficult or, at best, bittersweet. A recent wave of attacks on elderly Asian Americans — including the death of an 84-year-old San Francisco man — has fueled worries that hostilities have only worsened. In Cung's case, the man responsible for the attack believed the Myanmar man and his children were Chinese and spreading the virus, according to the FBI. Cung said he’s not sure what would have happened had a Sam’s Club employee, Zach Owen, not intervened. “Maybe I might kill him. Maybe he might kill all of my family. I don’t know,” Cung said. “God protected my family, God sent Zach to protect my family right there at the right time.” Owen, who was stabbed in the leg and deeply cut in his right palm, and an off-duty Border Patrol agent detained the suspect, Jose Gomez, 19. Verbal attacks have also made a lasting mark. In April, a confrontation in a Richmond, California, park left an irrevocable impact not just on Kelly Yang, 36, but her children. She was forced to discuss anti-Asian racism with her son, 10, and daughter, 7 — a talk she didn't think would happen for a few more years. An elderly white couple, upset over her unleashed dog, called Yang, who is Chinese American, an “Oriental” and said the words many Asian Americans dread: “Go back where you came from.” Her children thought the couple meant for them to go home. Torn, Yang eventually explained they meant “for us to go back to Asia."" ""It means that we’re not welcome here.” Her son burst into tears. Yang believes the couple felt emboldened by then-President Donald Trump’s use of racially charged terms like “Chinese virus."" She applauded President Joe Biden's recent executive order condemning anti-Asian xenophobia as a good start. But Yang is afraid a lot of non-Asians have already shrugged off the issue as though it ceased when Trump's presidency did. “I don’t know what can be done,” said Yang, who writes young adult novels and plans to weave her experience into her next book. “But I do know talking about it, acknowledging it, remembering — that’s what we do with wars — we have to remember what happened.” Douglas Kim, 42, chef and owner of Jeju Noodle Bar in New York City, is certain COVID-19-fueled racism was behind the April vandalizing of his Michelin-starred, Korean restaurant. Someone used a Sharpie to scrawl on the winter vestibule “Stop eating dogs,” referring to a stereotype about Asian cuisines. Ultimately, Kim decided not to report it. “At the time it pissed me off, but I have more important things to worry about,"" Kim said. ""Maintaining a business is more important.” He shared a picture of the graffiti on Instagram to call attention to hate crimes. There was a groundswell of support, but he feels like much of it has faded. Yet, Kim is hopeful fewer people are stereotyping Asian Americans as foreigners who don't belong in the U.S. “I think it’s all about education,” Kim said. “If you raise your children that way, they’re gonna learn that way. I think things are changing but it’s not 100% yet. That’s why somebody obviously wrote that on our door.” More than 3,000 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian American Pacific Islanders, and its partner advocacy groups, since mid-March 2020. What's frustrating is that the encounters don't often rise to the legal definition of a hate crime. Still, police in several major cities saw a sharp uptick in Asian-targeted hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, according to data collected by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, California State University, San Bernardino. New York City went from three incidents to 27, Los Angeles from seven to 15, and Denver had three incidents in 2020 — the first reported there in six years. A rash of crimes victimizing elderly Asian Americans in the past two months has renewed outcry for more attention from politicians and the media. On Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed off on legislation allocating $1.4 million to Stop AAPI Hate and the UCLA Asian American Studies Center. The funding will go toward community resources and further tracking of anti-Asian hate incidents. Local officials and citizens have also taken notice. Initiatives like increased police presence, volunteer patrols and special crime hotlines are coming to fruition. Big-name brands like the Golden State Warriors and Apple, based in the Bay Area, have promised to donate to the cause. Cynthia Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate, wishes news cycles would focus not just on the latest crimes but the solutions being discussed. Policing and prosecution aren't necessarily the answers, she said. COVID-19 vitriol is rooted in more than a century of anti-Chinese and anti-immigrant attitudes. She and other advocates think more investment in education and community resources could help get at those root causes. Anti-Asian xenophobia should be part of the ongoing conversations on racial reckoning, Choi added. “Our work to address anti-Asian racism is inextricably tied to fighting anti-Black racism,” Choi said. “That’s gonna take all of us, it’s gonna take public education efforts, it’s gonna take racial solidarity efforts that really bring our communities together."" Before immigrating to the U.S. six years ago, Cung, the Texas hate crime survivor, had never encountered racism. Now, it's difficult for him to hear stories about anti-Asian American violence. Initially after the attack, Cung wrestled with how Gomez tried to kill him simply because of how he looked. Now, he prays for his attacker. As for what should happen to Gomez, who remains jailed on three counts of attempted capital murder, Cung said that's up to the courts. “I can forgive him, but we cannot accept racism or that kind of terrorist attack,” said Cung, who received more than $20,000 in online donations. One thing he is looking ahead to — life as a newly naturalized U.S. citizen in a country where “they respect people.” Cung remains unbothered that he may not fit some people's idea of what America looks like. “Maybe personally they have racism,” Cung said. “I don’t care. I’m proud of being Asian and Asian American.” ——— Tang reported from Phoenix and is a member of The Associated Press’ Race and Ethnicity team. Follow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ttangAP"
https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/spread-coronavirus-vaccinated-76806052,lifestyle,Can I still spread the coronavirus after I'm vaccinated?,"NEW YORK -- Can I still spread the   after I’m vaccinated? It’s possible. Experts say the risk is low, but are still studying how well the shots blunt the spread of the virus. The current   are highly effective at preventing people from getting seriously sick with COVID-19. But even if vaccinated people don’t get sick, they might still get infected without showing any symptoms. Experts think the vaccine would also curb the chances of those people spreading the virus. “A vaccinated person controls the virus better, so the chances of transmitting will be greatly reduced,” said Dr. Robert Gallo a virus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Among the evidence so far: Studies suggesting if people do get infected despite vaccination, they harbor less coronavirus in the nose than the unvaccinated. That makes it harder to spread. Trying to settle the question, the U.S. is starting a study of college students willing to undergo daily nasal swab testing. Given the uncertainty and the arrival of more contagious variants, experts say fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and social distance in public and when visiting with unvaccinated people at high risk for severe illness if infected. “We still have to be cautious,” Gallo said. “The vaccine is essential. But it is not a cure-all that ends the epidemic tomorrow.” Other factors can also affect the likelihood of a vaccinated person spreading the virus, including vaccination rates in the community and whether there’s an ongoing surge in cases locally. “We want to think it’s all or none, but it’s very situation-specific,” said Dr. Laraine Lynn Washer, an infectious disease expert at the University of Michigan. —— The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in         this series.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the number of new cases over a 7-day period increased 7% over the previous week and hospitalizations are also increasing, which could be a warning sign for   in cases public health officials say could be avoided. ""I remain deeply concerned about this trajectory. We have seen cases and hospital admissions move from historic declines to stagnations to increases.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-gop-passed-georgia-law-restricting-voting/story?id=76708228,politics,Biden calls new GOP-passed Georgia law restricting voting access an 'atrocity' ,"President Joe Biden on Friday called a sweeping new Georgia law restricting voting access, passed by the state's Republican-led legislature, an ""atrocity,"" speaking to reporters as left the White House for Delaware. He  spoke shortly after issuing a statement on what he called the ""attack on the right to vote in Georgia,"" a state he won in November amid debunked claims of fraud. ""[I]nstead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote. This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience,"" Biden said in the statement. He later said the Justice Department was looking into the matter. On Thursday afternoon, Georgia Republicans voted to pass and sign into law a 90-page bill that severely limits voting rights in a previously Republican-dominated state that, besides Biden, also elected two Democratic senators in the 2020 election. Republicans said they were ensuring election integrity. When the bill was sent quickly to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature, a Democratic state representative from Atlanta, Park Cannon, went to his office, knocked on the governor's closed office door, demanding to be let in. In a scene caught on video, she was arrested by Georgia state troopers, taken from the building, and charged with a felony for obstruction of law enforcement and preventing or disrupting General Assembly sessions, according to the Georgia State Patrol. “I think anyone who saw that video would have been deeply concerned by the actions that were taken by law enforcement to arrest her when she simply, by the video that was provided, seemed to be knocking on the door to see if she could watch a bill being signed into law,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her Friday briefing. Biden, in his statement, said he would ""take his case to the American people."" ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the   Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Earlier Friday, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told CNN Biden will work to ensure the Senate passes the voting rights bill that could negate Georgia's new law, without being specific whether he would support doing   in order to get it done. ""You saw him speak to this yesterday, incredibly forcefully, you know, he said what we see going on here is sick, it's un-American,"" she said. ""So, yes, and he is going to work to push forward and ensure that we are signing this legislation into law."" However, with a very narrow Democratic majority in the Senate, passing the legislation might  , something Biden has maintained he doesn't want to do, but hinted Thursday that is might be an option to achieving policy goals. ""In terms of the filibuster, his great hope, his preference is we can work together on issues that matter tremendously to the American people,"" Bedingfield said. ""If Republicans refuse to do that, then as he said yesterday, he'll look at different options, but his hope is we can continue to work together."" ""What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote? Deciding that you're going to end voting at 5:00 when working people are just getting off work? Deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances?"" Biden said at his Thursday news conference. ""It's all designed."" He kept up his criticism in Friday's statement. ""Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over. It adds rigid restrictions on casting absentee ballots that will effectively deny the right to vote to countless voters. And it makes it a crime to provide water to voters while they wait in line – lines Republican officials themselves have created by reducing the number of polling sites across the state, disproportionately in Black neighborhoods,"" he said. Asked Friday how the voting rights issue affected his thinking on the Senate filibuster, Biden seemed to tamp down expectations. ""You know, you have to have 50 votes. 51 votes. You have to win to be able to move the filibuster, on any change in the filibuster. And right now, that doesn’t exist,"" he told reporters. ""That doesn’t exist. So, you know, look, I -- The only thing I’ve been relatively good at in my long career in the Senate is figuring out when to move and when not to move. You got to have the votes."" Georgia Gov. Kemp shot back at Biden Friday. ""There is nothing ‘Jim Crow’ about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot – every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person. President Biden, the left, and the national media are determined to destroy the sanctity and security of the ballot box,"" Kemp said in a statement."

Their message: Send the unaccompanied minors back. On Wednesday, there were 5,156 children   and 11,900 children in the Department of Health and Human Services' custody, according to data released by HHS. Along the way, we met a mother just moments after she stepped onto U.S. soil -- her 5-year-old daughter clenching her hand. It was just after midnight. With tears in her eyes, she told me she fought to come to the United States for her daughter. She was emotional, describing the journey -- saying it's been difficult. They went many days without food. As her little girl heard her mother cry, she began crying too. ""It’s been very difficult, a lot of days fighting with hunger on the way, and it’s not easy to just come, and hide from Guatemala’s immigration officers,"" she said. ""One comes alone without anyone that can help them, one comes alone, it's very difficult"" In the mother's pocket, a laminated piece of paper with the phone number of family in Maryland. Her husband already made it there with their son from Honduras. He said the time to come is now. President Joe Biden has said now is not the time to come, but pushed back against sending unaccompanied minors home during a press conference Thursday. ""The idea that I'm going to say, which I would never do, that if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we're just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side, no previous administration did that either, except Trump,"" Biden said. ""I’m not going to do it."" We met a 17-year-old from Guatemala who made the trip alone. He told us they he came out of ""necessity"" -- saying there weren't opportunities at home. He has no family in the United States, just the telephone number of a family friend who is a pastor. He's been on foot for more than a month. We followed more than a dozen senators to the edge of the river, Mexico just on the other side. You could hear people on rafts taunting them as they looked across. I asked Sen. Linsey Graham, D-S.C., if he believes that mother and child I just met should be sent back. ""I don't blame the mother and the daughter. I blame the policies we're creating. It’s incentivizing people to take a long dangerous journey."" he said. ""You have to stop the flow, you have to tell mother that she will no longer be released in the United States."" I asked: ""Do you want to send all the unaccompanied minors back across the border?"" ""Yes absolutely,"" he said: ""You got to shut it off, tell people not come."" Graham's message to Biden: ""End this madness. Come to the border and find out what is really happening on your watch."" Biden said during his press conference Thursday that he had not visited the border because it could put stress on an already precarious situation, though he did say he'd expand access to facilities where children are being held, especially for journalists. ""One of the reasons I haven't gone down, my chief folks have gone down, is I don't want to become the issue,"" Biden said. ""I don't want to be, you know, bringing all the secret service and everybody with me to get in the way."" I asked the senators: Were they outraged with the condition and policies under the Trump administration? ""What outrage? The outrage is that you entice people to do this,"" Graham said. He added, ""What President Biden did today at that news conference was a disaster. ... What he did is created a human tsunami that’s going to come to the United States. He didn’t mean to, but I don’t think he understands his own policies."" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said to me: ""Really what we’re asking is, should we keep the kids here and the parents are somewhere else in their country?"""

The Homeland Security Advisory Council is made up of 30 members -- both Democrats and Republicans. Some of those who were fired included allies of former President  , such as former acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli and former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan. ""I am considering how the HSAC can bring the greatest value to the Department and how the expertise, judgment, and counsel of its Members can be harnessed most effectively to advance the Department's mission. I expect to work closely with the HSAC and to rely on its Members to help guide the Department through a period of change,"" Mayorkas wrote. The HSAC produces reports and advises the secretary on a range of issues from domestic violent extremism to biometrics. ""In the service of an orderly transition to a new model for the HSAC, I have ended the term of current HSAC members effective March 26, 2021,"" he wrote. ""I will reconstitute the HSAC in the next few weeks, once the new model has been developed. Chairman William Bratton and Vice Chair Karen Tandy will remain in their HSAC leadership positions. William Webster will remain the HSAC's Chair Emeritus. I was privileged to work with Judge Webster throughout my prior service in the Department."" Bratton, Tandy and Webster are the only three members still listed on the  . Bratton, the former NYPD commissioner, serves as commissioner. Ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee John Katko, R-N.Y., slammed the action. ""While these members serve at the pleasure of the Secretary, today's action sends the message that this Administration has no intention of upholding a bipartisan, unifying approach to securing our homeland,"" Katko said. ""The HSAC is not intended to be an echo chamber for what the current DHS Secretary wants to hear. Its mission is to provide a knowledgeable, diverse set of perspectives to combat the evolving threats of today and tomorrow."" Trump's former acting DHS secretary, Chad Wolf, who appointed some of the members,   that it was a mistake as well. ""While I respect the right for a DHS Secretary to alter the HSAC to address their needs, dismissing the entire council outright and stopping a lot of important work (that was underway) is not the right approach,"" Wolf wrote."

Despite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines against travel, U.S. airlines say pent-up demand and mass-vaccination is drawing the highest number of reservation searches in a year. This comes as the   reports it screened more than a million passengers a day since March 11. United Airlines announced it will fly 52% of its 2019 schedule this summer -- the carrier adding 26 new non-stop routes to coastal vacation destinations taking off Memorial Day Weekend. ""In the past few weeks, we have seen the strongest flight bookings since the start of the pandemic,"" Ankit Gupta, vice president of United's domestic network planning and scheduling, said in a press release. ""As we rebuild our schedule to meet that demand, adding in seasonal point-to-point flying is just one of the ways we are finding opportunities to add new and exciting service."" The new service includes flights from Midwest cities like Cleveland, Cincinnati and Milwaukee to destinations like Hilton Head, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; and Portland, Maine. American Airlines also announced it will add 10 new, returning and seasonal routes from Austin. ""These routes not only provide opportunities for companies to get back to business and for leisure travelers to enjoy the excitement of Austin, but also connect Central Texans with new leisure destinations they desire,"" Brian Znotins, American’s vice president of Network Planning said in a press release.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/californians-recall-gov-gavin-newsom-process-work/story?id=76677007,politics,Why are some Californians trying to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom and how does the process work?,"The effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom is on the verge of a major victory. There are almost enough signatures in support of the effort to get the measure on the ballot, which would give voters the option to remove the governor from office and pick his replacement. Though organizers say they are nonpartisan, Republicans are rallying around the effort. According to the California secretary of state’s office, this is the   to recall Newsom since he took office in 2019. A recall is an action powered by voters who sign a petition in support of removing an elected official from office. If organizers are able to obtain enough signatures -- in this case just under 1.5 million -- the measure goes to a statewide ballot. Voters would then be presented with a two-part question: do they want to recall Newsom, and if so, who they would like to replace him with? Newsom recently signed a bill that would mail all voters a ballot for any elections in 2021. Anyone can file to be a replacement candidate in a recall election, which often leads to a very crowded field. Organizers in the effort to recall Newsom say government overreach has led to dissatisfaction with his leadership. They cite his executive order to phase out gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and rolling power outages to prevent wildfires, among other issues. They also cite a number of issues surrounding his handling of the coronavirus. The first attempt to recall Newsom came two months after he took office and was filed alongside recall attempts taking aim at six other top Democratic officials, including the lieutenant governor, the secretary of state and the attorney general. Newsom's handling of the coronavirus pandemic appears to be the catalyst for the latest recall effort. Randy Economy, a senior adviser to the effort, told ABC News that voters are trying to take the government back. ""People really do want to take citizen government back in their hands and they don't want the politicians to control every single aspect of their lives, every single minute of the day, even during a pandemic,"" Economy said. ""We're going to fix it by getting him out of office."" Californians previously successfully recalled Gov. Gray Davis in 2003, leading to the election of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Organizers met their final collection deadline on March 17. Their final count was just over 2.2 million signatures. Now counties have until April 29 to sift through the signatures and verify them. As of the last update on data through March 11, the state had received 1,834,770 signatures and examined 1,454,710 of them. Of those, 1,188,073 were deemed valid, giving organizers an 81.7% success rate. Recall expert Joshua Spivak told ABC News he doesn’t think organizers will have much difficulty making it to a ballot. ""Six million people voted for Donald Trump (in California),"" Spivak said. ""So with one-third of those 6 million signing this petition, forgetting Democrats, forgetting independents ... there's a good chance that will get on the ballot. That is not some crazy barrier."" Still, getting voters to cast a ballot for the recall may prove difficult. Of the total 22,154,304 registered voters in the state, 10,228,144 are Democrats, 5,347,377 are Republicans and 680,573 are independents. This is the second recall attempt primarily led by former Yolo County Sergeant Orrin Heatlie and California businessman Mike Netter. Organizers say they have raised just under $1 million in donations. Though organizers claim the effort is nonpartisan, records show contributions from the   totaling at least $100,000. The Republican National Committee has  the effort and the Republican Governor's Association recently launched a political action committee to do the same. As the signature verification rate climbed, Democrats in California and across the country launched a defensive,   and supporters of the effort to the far-right wings of the Republican Party and the QAnon conspiracy. They argue that removing a sitting governor as he tries to quell the coronavirus pandemic would be harmful to the state. Stop the Republican Recall, the campaign against the effort, is primarily funded by the California Democratic Party and has recruited national party figures, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Stacey Abrams, to help fundraise. Newsom publicly addressed the threat of a recall on ABC’s “The View,” saying it appeared that organizers had the signatures needed to send the question to a ballot. ""Am I worried about it? Of course I'm worried about it,"" Newsom said. ""The nature of these things, the up or down question, the zero-sum nature of the question is challenging...so we're taking it seriously."" The state has until April 29 to verify signatures submitted on the remaining petitions. The state then has 10 days to verify that the signatures make the required threshold. Following that, those who signed a petition have 30 days to remove their names from the list. Experts predict the question could be on a ballot by September or October. Democrats are putting up a united front of opposition to the recall and are not announcing bids for the seat. But some have reportedly quietly expressed interest in jumping in a potential governor’s race down the road. Tom Steyer, one of the failed 2020 presidential candidates who spent millions on his own race, recently commissioned a poll on a number of issues, including the recall. His spokesperson told ABC News that he opposes the recall effort and has no intention of running should it get on the ballot. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a Republican, has already jumped into the race and is calling on voters to elect him for a “California Comeback.” Republican John Cox, who was the party’s nominee in the 2018 gubernatorial election, has also thrown his name in the ring, as has former Republican Rep. Doug Ose."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-takes-long-view-matter-timing-presidency-agenda/story?id=76704106,politics,"Biden takes the long view: 'It's a matter of timing,' he says of presidency, agenda","For President  , it's all about timing. Faced with an unprecedented array of crises, from the   pandemic to gun violence, Biden this week made clear that is looking back through the long lens of history as he formulates his agenda. ""Successful presidents -- better than me -- have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they’re doing -- order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done,"" he said during a news conference Thursday. After two major mass shootings in a week, Biden made clear that crises he viewed as secondary would not deter him from staying laser-focused on his top priorities: ending the coronavirus pandemic and repairing the economy. Next up, he said, would be rebuilding America's infrastructure, a not-so-flashy task that, if he's successful, could have a lasting impact on his legacy in line with consequential presidents before him, like Franklin D. Roosevelt and his ""New Deal"" or Dwight Eisenhower and the interstate highway system. Biden's pragmatism is born out of his decades of passing bills on Capitol Hill, and it stands in stark contrast to his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Trump often bounced from one issue to the next chasing headlines, with little interest in figuring out how to actually move his proposals across the finish line at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. ""It's a matter of timing,"" Biden said Thursday, explaining why he did not think now was the time to spend his political capital on gun control. ""When I took office,"" he told another reporter, ""I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that's why I put all my focus in the beginning -- there are a lot of problems -- put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems."" Biden called the issues of immigration reform, climate change, voting rights and gun control ""long-term problems"" that have ""been around a long time."" ""And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well,"" he said. But, he added, the ""fundamental problem"" was how to help people regain their financial well being. The president met earlier this month with a group of historians, which White House press secretary Jen Psaki said was a chance to for Biden to have ""an open conversation about the challenges"" the United States is facing while ""looking back at history."" ""It's a moment to step back and reflect and use it as lessons moving forward,"" Psaki said Wednesday. After gaining passage of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this month, Biden said his next big push would be improving the nation's infrastructure -- ""so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs,"" he explained Thursday. With the United States inching out of a historic pandemic and reeling economically, Biden may seize on the moment to go big with a transformative spending plan that could have a lasting impact on the country's bridges, roads and tunnels and put thousands of Americans back to work. This week, administration officials prepared to present the president with a massive economic plan, covering infrastructure and other domestic priorities, with a total cost as high as $3 trillion, according to a White House official. Axios, which  , said it was clear during the meeting that Biden ""knew a lot about Franklin D. Roosevelt"" and asked questions about the president who brought the United States the massive relief programs and transformative policy changes that made up the 1930s New Deal. White House officials did not respond to specific questions about the meeting, which Axios reported lasted over two hours and also touched on former President Lyndon B. Johnson. But presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told ABC News that while Biden may be interested in the impact Roosevelt's New Deal had, Biden faces far greater constraints than the wildly popular, four-term Roosevelt did, nor does he enjoy a large majority of Democrats in the Senate like Johnson had. While Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives, the evenly split Senate -- with ties broken by Vice President Kamala Harris -- means that the opposition of any one Democrat could prevent a bill's passage. ""The truth of the matter is, Biden is like a third Obama administration,"" Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, said, referring to the obstructionism President Barack Obama faced from congressional Republicans. ""We are a deeply divided country, and the idea of getting a legislative agenda done without any Republican help is very hard."" While people familiar with the $3 trillion spending plans stressed they were preliminary -- as was the price tag -- if Biden moves forward, he is likely to face stiff opposition from Republicans in Congress. The president was unable to garner even one GOP vote in favor of the COVID-19 relief bill. ""I would like Republican -- elected Republican support,"" Biden said Thursday, ""but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I'm doing."" On Thursday, Biden dismissed Republican opposition to one issue, immigration reform, by nodding to the lasting impact Trump has had on the GOP. ""I know they have to posture for a while,"" Biden said. ""They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a -- but I’m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better."" But Biden is running up against the time crunch of the traditional ""honeymoon period"" for new presidents, where their typically higher approval ratings allow them to push through more ambitious agenda items. Obama, for example, tackled major healthcare reform soon he took office. ""Since Franklin D. Roosevelt unleashed his 100 days of the New deal, there's been pressure on presidents to deliver results quickly, because the press starts saying, 'What did you do in your first 100 days?'"" Brinkley said. ""This is just part of a media culture that's developed particularly now with TV, especially in the 1950s with television. It starts becoming this big litmus test."" That dynamic is likely fueling Biden's infrastructure goals, he said. The 2022 midterms, too, are bearing down upon the president. ""There used to be a honeymoon period for presidents,"" Brinkley said. ""If that exists anymore, it's only for a couple of months. And so you're naturally trying to get out of the gate with something big quickly."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgias-election-law-marks-1st-battle-voting-rights/story?id=76701964,politics,Georgia's new election law marks 1st battle in voting rights war,"The sweeping  s bill signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp  While Iowa's governor signed a bill earlier this month imposing new restrictions on voting, the elections overhaul Kemp signed into law Thursday evening is the first major, post-2020 election legislative action in a battleground state former President Donald Trump lost and continuously contested with baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud and election irregularities. Republicans in Arizona, another new battleground state Trump lost with competitive elections next cycle,   restrictive voting legislation, but such bills are not just under consideration in  . In states with Republican governors that Trump won, like Texas and Florida, GOP legislators have also proposed legislation that would restrict voter access. In Florida, for example, one bill that has advanced through committees would eliminate the use of drop boxes entirely, which Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who -- like Kemp -- faces reelection in 2022, advocated for. Vote-by-mail was popular in Florida pre-pandemic, and for all statewide elections between 2014 and 2018, Republicans favored the option more than Democrats. In Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, the top election official in the state, resisted pressure to overturn the presidential election in favor of Trump, but the new law now strips him of his chairmanship and voting power on the State Election Board. By a majority vote, the General Assembly will now appoint three of the five voting members of the board, including the chairperson, and by a majority vote, that board will have new power to suspend county election superintendents deemed unfit for the role and appoint temporary replacements. Voting rights is shaping up to be a defining issue of the 2022 cycle. ""I think both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- are going to point to aspects of this to mobilize their base,"" said University of Georgia Professor Charles Bullock, an expert in Southern politics. Bullock told ABC News that Republicans will ""continue their narrative that elections in Georgia can be easily stolen,"" but point to this bill as a firewall. But it's also a useful, ""very effective message"" for Democrats, he added, who can point to the bill and build on the narrative that shaped the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, ""that Republicans are out to suppress the vote,"" but Democrats can stop them by voting. In a statement Friday, President Joe Biden echoed voting rights advocates, calling the bill ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century."" ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end,"" he said of the bill. ""We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote."" The fight over voting rights is just getting started. The Washington-based attorney who led the charge to expand voting access during the pandemic and countered former Trump's post-election legal pursuits, Marc Elias,   against the new legislation in Georgia on behalf of the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter and Rise. The filing came right after a Black Democratic state lawmaker was arrested for trying to witness Kemp's bill signing, which happened behind closed doors but in front of the press. A   reviewed by ABC News shows Rep. Park Cannon knocking on the door where Kemp was signing the bill. After continuing to knock, she is eventually handcuffed by state troopers who tell her she's under arrest. Protesters who had joined her at the door erupted in anger and disbelief as she was practically dragged out of the State Capitol by the officers. She faces two charges, obstruction of law enforcement and preventing or disrupting General Assembly sessions or other meetings of members, according to a statement from Georgia State Patrol obtained by ABC's Atlanta affiliate WSB. ""I’ve been released from jail. I am not the first Georgian to be arrested for fighting voter suppression. I’d love to say I’m the last, but we know that isn’t true,"" Cannon  . She said the ""closed-door signing"" of the bill was a ""product of a white supremacist system."" Nse Ufot, the CEO of the New Georgia Project accused Kemp of cowardice for signing the bill not just behind closed doors but just an hour after it was passed. Bills often go unsigned until the legislative sessions ends, which isn't until March 31. Asked what she made of the   signing the bill told her, Ufot said, ""Georgia's pale, stale, male minority has an outsized influence on our politics and they feel their grip slipping."" Rev. Raphael Warnock, Georgia's first Black senator who faces reelection in 2022, was with Cannon, one of his parishioners, after she was released from jail. ""I got news for the state of Georgia for those who are trying to take the people's voices. We're going to keep on -- in various ways, we're going to keep on knocking on that door. Because that wasn't just Representative Cannon knocking on the door,"" Warnock told reporters Friday. In his bill signing remarks, Kemp said the bill will make it ""easy to vote and hard to cheat,"" echoing Republicans in the state legislature. He also took a shot at its critics. ""Georgians will no doubt be soon overwhelmed with fancy TV ads, mailers and radio spots attacking this common-sense election reform measure. In fact, left-wing groups funded by out-of-state billionaires are already doing that now. They're using outrageous, false rhetoric to scare you and put millions of dollars in their own pocket,"" Kemp said. ""According to them, if you support voter ID for absentee ballots, you're a racist. According to them, if you believe in protecting the security and sanctity of the ballot box, you're a 'Jim Crow in a suit and tie.'"" In Georgia, there ""is a long history of aggressively and intentionally suppressing Black votes that needs to be addressed,"" said Ufot, but she added that, ""an attack on our democracy and an attack on the right to vote is an attack on us all."" She told ABC News that the GOP is threatened by the changing demographics and electorate, in Georgia and across the country. ""The current version of the Republican Party and people who champion their policies see this rise in a multiracial, multiethnic progressive majority as a threat to their future prospects ... America's Browning. We're moving towards a multiracial, multiethnic majority, and Georgia is just the tip of the spear,"" she said. ""They think that they can no longer win on their ideas."""

https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/bread-cameos-year-income-broadway-stage-76415101,lifestyle,Bread and Cameos — a year without income from Broadway stage,"NEW YORK -- A year ago, Max Kumangai was dazzling crowds with a jolt of live Broadway excitement. Now he’s doing it with his bread. The triple threat from the musical “Jagged Little Pill” has leaned into a fourth skill as the pandemic marches on: baking and selling his own sourdough. From his Manhattan apartment, Kumangai delivers $15 bread loaves or $8 focaccia slices from his         Humpday Dough company on foot or via subway. “I wanted to make connecting with people — at a time when it was difficult to connect — a part of the business,” he says. “It’s feeding me figuratively and literally.” With TV and film sets slowly gearing back up a year after COVID-19 hit, Broadway theaters are still shuttered with no end in sight. That means people who make their living in live entertainment have had to be creative. Out-of-work seamstresses are selling handmade jewelry and plush toys on Etsy, dancers are teaching classes online and actors are doing voiceover work, podcasts or selling video shout-outs on Cameo. “This is a paycheck-to-paycheck profession. We are workers,” says Laura Benanti, a Tony winner. “It’s really deeply upsetting to me that there are so many people suffering, unable to feed themselves. They don’t have savings.” According to         a new report from the New York State Comptroller, employment for New York City workers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors fell 66% during the pandemic. The drop — from 87,000 jobs in February 2020 to 34,100 jobs just three months later — marks the largest employment decline out of all sectors in the city’s economy. It has left Broadway workers, many who have lost health insurance, living on side gigs, stimulus checks and unemployment assistance. “I’ve had a lot of friends who just picked up and relocated and moved to different states because we’re staying in one of the most expensive states in the country,” says Jawan M. Jackson, a star of “Ain’t Too Proud — The Life and Times of The Temptations.” He pivoted to putting out a single, filming a movie and got into commercials. He wished government leaders would do more. “We kind of feel like we are just afterthoughts,” he said. “I just wish they would have been a little bit better during the shutdown for us because of the predicament that we’re in. But hopefully it’s going to change. We’ll see.” Others are more blunt: “These artists need to be protected. They need to be supported. This is dire straits right now,” said Tom Kitt, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer. “This is the lifeblood of this city.” Theater work even without a pandemic is usually a piecemeal existence. Shows rarely run for years and workers live a nomadic existence, jumping to new works every few years. These days, they're even more piecemeal since people who make live theater will clearly be the last back at work. “You pick up things where you can. I know a lot of people that have taken on side gigs when they can. A lot of people have gone back to school,” said Derek Klena, a Tony-nominee. “You do what you can to get by.” Musician Andrew Griffin had landed a great gig playing viola for “Ain’t Too Proud"" when the pandemic shut down his steady gig. He has cobbled together a few live concerts, composed for a dance company and done some consulting work. He's seen people selling their instruments and their cars. One woman close to him has even sold her eggs. “It’s definitely been very challenging and very stressful in a lot of different ways,” he says. Some of Broadway's leading men — including Jeremy Jordan, Max von Essen, Corey Cott and Adam Pascal — have turned to         Cameo, which pays celebrities to make personalized videos for fans. “I’ve clawed my way to paying those bills each month,” says Pascal, a Tony-nominee for “Rent” who has made his own rent this year teaching masterclasses and with concerts. “Pivoting in whatever way I’m able to pivot.” Some of Broadway's leading ladies — from Patti Murin, Cassie Levy, Kerry Butler, Lilli Cooper to Ashley Park — have been coaching, singing and answering questions virtually on         Broadway Booker, which pivoted from hosting in-person events to online ones. A 30-minute private coaching session from a veteran can start at $75. Broadway dancer Jen Frankel lost her job but quickly become an employer: She co-founded the virtual dance platform         PassDoor, hiring suddenly out-of-work Broadway veterans to teach all skill levels or ages. “We thought, 'Here’s an opportunity for not only us to help the Broadway community, but also to help everybody by giving them a chance to dance with people that they never would have.” Bebe Neuwirth, a two-time Tony winner who also starred on “Cheers,” works with dancers on career transitions and worries about the losses to her art form from the pandemic. “I know a lot of dancers are saying, ‘OK, I got to get a scholarship and go back to school and do something, because I can’t make it work,’” she says. ""Who knows what those dancers might have done if they’d stayed?” ——— Mark Kennedy is at         http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"

Still, there are warning signs for other areas of his agenda where external events have imposed new urgency, a new   finds. The president's approval lands at 72% for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, numerically higher than the 68% of Americans who   just before Congress passed his $1.9 trillion relief package, his first  . Only 28% disapprove of his response in the poll, which was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. A significant slice of the country also backs how Biden is handling distribution of the COVID-19  , with 3 in 4 Americans approving. More than one-third of the adult population (35%) has received at least one dose, according to the most recent report from the  . On Thursday, Biden opened his   as president by pledging to double his initial goal on administering vaccines to 200 million doses by the end of his first 100 days in office. A clear majority of Americans (60%) also approve of Biden's stewardship on repairing the beleaguered economy, which continues to be hobbled by the coronavirus, and nearly 4 in 10 Americans disapprove. Biden's standing on the pandemic is buttressed by overwhelming support from those who identify with his party, with about 9 in 10 Democrats approving of his handling of the public health crisis (96%), vaccine delivery (92%) and the economic response (89%). Strong majorities of independents also approve of Biden on all three fronts: 74%, 77% and 63%, respectively. Notably, in these polarized times, a majority of Republicans (53%) also approve of Biden's handling of vaccine distribution. Fewer than half, however, view his overall response to the pandemic (44%) and his leadership on the economy (23%) positively. Biden, at the same time, is facing some early tests in his first two months in office, finding himself underwater for his handling of gun violence   in a week and the   crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, which has brought at least 18,000 unaccompanied children into U.S. custody. An equal 57% of Americans disapprove of his approach on both issues, while just over 4 in 10 Americans approve. As Biden attempts to balance the various intervening forces, he   that he viewed the two issues of gun control and   as secondary to the pandemic and its fallout, calling them ""long-term problems"" despite their increasing urgency. ""They've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin one at a time to focus on those as well,"" he said at the first press conference on Thursday. ""Successful presidents -- better than me -- have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they're doing -- order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done,"" he later added. Republicans are   at the southern border as a ""crisis"" -- a term that White House aides have refused to invoke while also acknowledging the troubling circumstances -- and accusing the current administration's hasty rollback of tough immigration policies implemented by former President Donald Trump as the cause. A majority of Americans (54%) call the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border a crisis, and another 42% believe it is a serious problem but not a crisis. Only 4% of Americans say it is not a serious problem. The issue of immigration is one of the most polarizing among those included in the poll, with clear majorities of Republicans (89%) and independents (54%) disapproving of Biden, while one-third of Democrats say the same. Similarly, Biden's handling of gun violence draws disapproval from 86% of Republicans, 56% of independents and 37% of Democrats -- the highest dissatisfaction among members of his own party of the issues asked about in the survey. The disapproval from both sides is likely seen by Republicans as pursuing too many gun restrictions and by some Democrats as not acting quickly enough. The president suggested on Thursday that he wouldn't expend his political capital on gun control reform right now, a view that appears at odds with most of the country. Roughly two-thirds of Americans in the poll said that enacting new laws to try to reduce gun violence should be a higher priority now, while 34% believe protecting gun rights should take precedence. Biden has repeatedly underlined a desire to unify the country after four years with a divisive Trump at the helm, but so far, he's made little headway. While 30% of Americans think Biden is making the country more united, the same percentage think he is making it more divided. A plurality of 40% view his presidency as neutral on national unity. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (66%) think Biden is further dividing the country, and a combined 33% say he's either improving unity (5%) or having no effect (28%). Among Democrats, 95% say Biden is making the country more united (55%) or having no effect either way (40%), while 5% say he's perpetuating divisions. Independents are more split: 28% say more united, 26% say more divided and 46% say neither."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgia-lawmaker-shaken-resolved-arrest-election-bill-signing/story?id=76725949,politics,Georgia lawmaker 'shaken but resolved' following arrest at election bill signing ,"Following the arrest of Rep. Park Cannon D-Ga., for knocking on the door while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping election bill this week, her attorney said Cannon is ""shaken but resolved"" to continue the fight for voting rights in Georgia -- and to clear her name. Cannon faces charges of obstructing law enforcement and disrupting a general assembly session after she repeatedly knocked on the door of Kemp's office as he held a private livestream of the bill signing. The 90-page bill adds new voting requirements for Georgia residents following the results of the 2020 election that flipped the traditionally red state to blue. A viral video of Cannon, who is a Black woman, being forcibly escorted out of the statehouse by Georgia state troopers, even after she identified herself as a state representative, sparked national outrage. She argued that the public and other members of the General Assembly should be allowed to witness the event. ""It reminds us of the 50s and the 60s in Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia and South Carolina,"" Cannon's attorney, Gerald Griggs, said. ""But I think the governor needs to understand that we are not going to sit back on George Wallace type tactics and not respond the same way we responded to George Wallace. So I think the rest of the country needs to take a very strong look at the tactics that are being used in Georgia. The Justice Department needs to get involved. There needs to be passage of the   Voting Rights Act to protect voting rights. And we need the Justice Department to crack down on the tactics of these local and state officials that are trying to silence voters and silence people."" Griggs said Cannon was arrested in an area that state lawmakers normally have access to and added she did not expect to be apprehended by law enforcement. ""She has access to all parts of the People's House and so there was no indication that the ceremony should have been closed off. Many times when a governor signs bills that are going to go into law, it's open to the public, to the press and to other members of the House of Representatives and the state Senate,"" Griggs said. Griggs told ABC News that Cannon plans to return to the Georgia State Capitol on Monday to keep working. He also said the state of Georgia should expect a ""prolonged legal fight"" even if charges are dismissed. ""She'll be doing the job that she was elected to do for her district and the people of Georgia. And as far as the charges are concerned, they're just allegations at this point. They have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Griggs said. ""The constitution of the state of Georgia is quite clear on that a duly elected representative cannot be arrested during a session. That's a violation of the Constitution unless there are three exceptions: One would be a felony, two would be a breach of the peace and three would be a treason. We believe, based on the facts and evidence that we have uncovered so far, neither of those exceptions apply,"" he added. Griggs said he and Cannon's team are in touch with the district attorney's office and are hopeful that the charges will be dismissed. He also said Kemp and Cannon have not spoken to each other since the incident -- and that Kemp has not reached out. Griggs wouldn't say if Cannon is owed an apology. President Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and other prominent Democrats have expressed support for Cannon, many sharing photos that compare her to civil rights protesters in the 1960s. When asked if that was her intention, Griggs said she's trying to ""make sure that the voices of the voters in her district and around the state of Georgia were amplified."" Kemp has defended the bill and his decision to sign it into law and continued to do so Saturday on Fox News. ""Well, I can truthfully look in the camera and ask my African American friends and other African Americans in Georgia to simply find out what's in the bill versus the blank statement of this is Jim Crow or this is voter suppression, or this is racist -- because it is not,"" Kemp said."

Dan Sullivan","ANNOUNCER: ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos"" starts right now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN KARL, ""THIS WEEK"" CO-ANCHOR (voice-over):  President Biden's first press conference. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Please, please sit down. Thank you. KARL:  Facing a crisis at the border. QUESTION:  Is what's happening inside acceptable to you? BIDEN:  That's a serious question, right? Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That is totally unacceptable. KARL:  And under pressure to act on gun violence. BIDEN:  It's a matter of timing. KARL:  Plus: the battle over voting rights. GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  Georgia will take another step to ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair. KARL:  Georgia's governor saying the new law will make elections more secure. But with no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud, critics are calling it a way to suppress the vote. BIDEN:  It's an atrocity. This is nothing but punitive, designed to keep people from voting. KARL:  With his agenda on the line, does Biden want to change the way the Senate does business? BIDEN:  We're going to get a lot done. And if we have to, if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we will have to go beyond what I'm talking about. KARL:  We cover it all this morning with White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield and Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, plus our powerhouse roundtable. And Biden sets a new vaccine goal. BIDEN:  Two hundred million shots in 100 days. KARL:  But the pandemic is far from over. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR:  I'm quite concerned about the rise, because we have seen this pattern before. KARL:  The latest with Dr. Ashish Jha. (END VIDEOTAPE) ANNOUNCER:  From ABC News, it's ""This Week."" Here now, chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl. KARL:  Good morning, and welcome to ""This Week."" President Biden's first press conference was a reminder of just how much has changed since his predecessor left the White House. Biden, who waited more than two months to have his first press conference, seems to want his policies to take center stage, not himself. And that may be the most profound difference between the 45th and 46th presidents. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that public opinion on Biden's work so far varies dramatically depending on the issue. In a ABC News/Ipsos poll out this morning, Biden has a sky-high approval rating when it comes to his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine distribution, and economic recovery. But when it comes to his handling of gun violence and the situation at the border with Mexico, most Americans don't approve. In other words, President Biden is off to a good start on issues where he has been able to set the agenda, but not so much on issues where the real world has interfered. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIDEN:  Successful electoral politics is the art of possible. KARL (voice-over):  The art of the possible, but the Biden agenda is ambitious, aiming at as big an expansion of government as anything since LBJ's Great Society, although, in his first presidential press conference, President Biden's sought to downplay expectations. BIDEN:  Successful presidents better than me have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they're doing, order it, decide priorities. KARL:  His first priority was COVID relief, next up, something bigger. BIDEN:  Rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure in this country. KARL:  But, as just about every president learns... DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS:  Tonight, breaking news as we come on the air, a gunman opening fire at a grocery store. KARL:  ... the real world imposes its own priorities, with mass shootings in Atlanta and Colorado, pressure yet again to act on gun safety and mental health, missile launches and more threats from North Korea, and, at the border, a massive influx of children and families and a system simply unable to deal with it. On Mexico's border with California, some migrants have worn T-shirts saying, ""Biden, please let us in."" Others have said they are coming because that is exactly what they expect the new president to do. BIDEN:  That's the reason why it's happening, that I'm a decent man or however it's phrased, that that's why they're coming, because they know Biden's a good guy. The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. KARL:  While surges this time of year are common, and the president has said migrants should not make the dangerous journey, much has changed. We are now seeing record numbers of unaccompanied children crossing the border. There are now more than 18,000 unaccompanied minors in U.S. custody. ABC's Cecilia Vega met 9-year-old Yossell after he took the treacherous journey from Honduras without his parents. QUESTION:  So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging, in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process, encouraging families like Yossell's to come? BIDEN:  The idea that I'm going to say, which I would never do, that unaccompanied child ends up at the border we’re just going to let them starve to death and stay on the other side. No previous administration did that either, except Trump. I'm not going to do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) JON KARL, ABC HOST, (OFF-CAMERA): Visiting the border this week, a group of republican senators told our Rachel Scott that children should be sent back home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL SCOTT, ABC CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We just met a mother -- SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC): Yes. SCOTT: -- with her 5-year-old. GRAHAM: Yes. SCOTT: She was in tears -- GRAHAM: Yes. SCOTT: -- crossing the border. GRAHAM: Yes. SCOTT: What do you do? Do you send that mother and her 5-year-old child -- GRAHAM: Absolutely. SCOTT: -- back across the border? GRAHAM: Absolutely. Yes, you do. SCOTT: They should go back across the border -- GRAHAM: Absolutely. SCOTT: -- after making this trek here -- GRAHAM: You do not -- SCOTT: -- looking for a better life GRAHAM: Absolutely -- SCOTT: -- looking for asylum. GRAHAM: There's the legal way to get here and there's the illegal way to get here. I don't blame them. I blame us. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL, (OFF-CAMERA): The Biden administration has refused to allow journalists to see the inside the most crowded facilities housing migrants at the border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN: Will you commit to transparency on this issue? BIDEN: I will commit to transparency, and as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we're doing right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL, (OFF-CAMERA): But the Republican senators did get a look inside and they released their own images. Overcrowded under any circumstances, especially during a pandemic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT: Can you describe for us what you saw? SEN. TED CRUZ, (R-TX): I think the most striking was the Donna facility. Literally side by side children who are lying down -- lying down on the floor. They don't have beds. They're lying down on the floor. They're right next to each other. They're touching each other. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL (ON-CAMERA): A lot to cover this morning with our first guest, White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield. Kate, we thank you very much for joining us on this Sunday. I want to start with those images from the Donna detention center. I mean, obviously not acceptable, horrific. Not acceptable by the definition put forward by the president himself. What is the immediate problem to address this and when will it be fixed?KATE BEDINGFIELD, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, the president is working as quickly as possible to address the situation. He's using every possible avenue to ensure that we're getting these kids out of Border Patrol custody and into HHS facilities as quickly as possible. You've seen him just this week announce that Fort Bliss, for example, and Lackland Air Force base are going to open up beds to bring these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities and into facilities that are better for temporary housing for them, but that's a temporary solution. It's a temporary solution. Ultimately what we need to do is address the root causes of migration. It's something that President Biden did when he was vice president. He spent time in the Northern Triangle countries that people are migrating from, working to try to address the lack of infrastructure, the lack of programs, like for example, girls and boys clubs that allow these kids to be somewhere safe in their home country. So you saw last week, he asked Vice President Harris to take on dealing with the work and the diplomacy that's necessary in the Northern Triangle to prevent people from making this journey in the first place. That's the most important thing we can do to try to stem the tide. And the other thing I would say, Jon, is what we see from the data is that these surges are cyclical. They’re cyclical. They're not the result of one administration's policies or another administration's policies. They’re the result of, for example, weather disasters in the region. They're the result of people fleeing poverty and violence. So we saw spikes in 2014. We saw them in 2019 when the Trump administration had perhaps the cruelest imaginable policies in place, family separation to try to deter people from coming, and they still came. So this is a cyclical issue. It’s one that President Biden has said is unacceptable to him and he's working very quickly to address it. KARL: But, Kate, there is something different here, and that is the unaccompanied minors, and we already have a record number of unaccompanied minors in U.S. custody. And in just a single day last week, there were 1,000 additional minors who were caught capturing -- who were brought into U.S. custody coming across the border. These are record numbers already, and the seasonal surge that you’re talking about is only just beginning. This is not -- I mean, in terms of unaccompanied numbers, this is not the same as it's been. This is worse. Is it not? BEDINGFIELD: Well, no. And if you look at the numbers, it's not -- KARL: But the numbers -- BEDINGFIELD: -- but that doesn’t mean it’s not a serious -- but that doesn't mean -- but, Jon -- I’m sorry. Go ahead. KARL: No, but I'm saying these are already record numbers of unaccompanied minors, a thousand in a single day. BEDINGFIELD: And it’s -- KARL: Already record numbers. It’s not the same -- BEDINGFIELD: And the president -- and the president -- and the -- it is the -- it is the same. These are the same kinds of surges that we've seen. But look, the important thing here, it's not a question of whether it's the same or not, the important thing here is the president has said this is unacceptable to him and he's working to address it. And the way we do that is by finding temporary shelter for these kids who are coming without an adult and also by speeding up the process, by ensuring that the process is more efficient so that kids are able to move out of these Border Patrol facilities into temporary housing and then be put into the -- into immigration processes. That's what we're working to try to do as quickly as possible. But I think it's also important to be clear that our policy hasn't changed. The vast majority of people who arrive at our border we're turning away under Title 42, under a health code that requires us to or allows us to turn people away in this period of COVID. So people should understand that the vast majority of people who show up at our border we're turning away. For these unaccompanied children who arrive, the president is working as quickly as possible to move them into facilities that are acceptable, that are in and of themselves, short-term -- short-term solutions, and he's working to rebuild our system of diplomacy in the Northern Triangle so that people are not fleeing these countries coming to the United States. That's how we ultimately solve the problem. KARL:  Congressman Henry Cuellar, who is a Democrat and also somebody very familiar with that border region, has said that the administration should show images, should show video of people being turned away at the border, to send that message of visual representation of that message that most people are being turned away. Is that something that the administration is considering doing? BEDINGFIELD:  Well, I think the president has been very clear the border is closed. He has said so unequivocally many, many times. And we’re working -- our State Department is working to show media in country -- in the countries in the Northern Triangle that make very clear, that the border is not open, and that coming to make this incredibly dangerous journey now is coming to our border is not -- this is not the moment to do it. This is not the time to do it. The border is closed. But, you know, what I would say more prod broadly is, you know, this is also an issue that Democrats and Republicans have historically shared a desire to work on. And so this is a moment where, you know, you talked about Republicans going to visit these facilities. You know, this is a moment for Republicans to come to the table, to work with us on comprehensive immigration reform. President Biden sent a bill to Congress on his first day in office, addressing some of the broken pieces of our administration system and working to, for example -- KARL:  OK. BEDINGFIELD:  -- create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country. So, there are opportunities to work together and constructively. That's what the American people want us to do. That's what President Biden wants to do. KARL:  So, Kate, I want to turn to Georgia's new restrictions -- the new restrictive voting law down there. The president, obviously, harshly critical, many others as well. We see talk from Major League Baseball potentially moving the all-star game which is scheduled for this summer in Atlanta as a form of protest. Also, there's even been calls for the Masters to be removed -- to be moved out of Augusta. Does the administration support these kind of moves by the sports and entertainment industry to effectively boycott Georgia because of this? BEDINGFIELD:  Well, I think President Biden has been pretty clear how he feels about the legislation. He called it sick. He called it un-American. He said that it runs counter to everything that we stand for as Americans. He believes that we need to pass the For the People Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. This is something that he’s going to push to ensure that we're signing into law. So, I think he's been very clear. He believes this is un-American. It's unacceptable, and he's also said, you know, if you have the best ideas, put them on the table, and let people vote. There's -- the idea that you need to suppress the vote or prevent people in this country from voting in order to win, I mean, it truly runs counter to everything that we believe as Americans. So, he's been very clear about how he feels about this. Obviously, the private sector and private companies will make decisions on their own, but he's been clear this is entirely unacceptable to him, and he’s going to work to ensure that Congress is passing laws that protect people’s right to vote. KARL:  I mean, one thing that is truly concerning about this, these efforts are entirely party line. These are Republicans, these are partisan efforts. But even the effort in Congress to try to combat this is entirely without Republican support. I want to show you something that Joe Manchin said about the effort in Congress to ensure voting rights. He said: Pushing through legislation of this magnitude on a partisan basis may garner short-term benefits, but it will inevitably only exacerbate the distrust that millions of Americans harbor against the U.S. government. So, does -- I mean, obviously, Joe Biden ran for president talking about bringing the country together. This seems to be a really tough one. Does he find -- is he going to be able to find a way to get Republicans -- Republicans in Congress on board in a bipartisan effort to deal with how we conduct our elections? BEDINGFIELD:  Well, this is a question for the Republicans, isn't it, Jon? KARL:  Well, it’s a question -- (CROSSTALK) BEDINGFIELD:  I mean, they're the ones who are saying that they can't support -- KARL:  It's a question for President Biden on, you know, what is his plan to try to, you know, bring Republicans on board to this, or are they a lost cause? I mean, how does the White House view this? BEDINGFIELD:  That's -- I would say that's a question for them, that President Biden has been very clear that this is something he believes needs to happen. You know, we -- there's a lot of conversation about how this legislation could move forward in the Senate and discussion of what we need to do to the filibuster. But, you know, I thought Senator Warnock was right on about this yesterday or a couple of days ago when he said, you know, we wouldn't have to be talking about the filibuster if Republicans were talking about supporting voting rights. So this is a question for Republicans. Are they going to look their constituents in the eye and say, I spent my time in Washington trying to make it harder for you to cast your vote? Is that really the argument that they want to take back to their constituents? That's a question for them. President Biden has been very, very clear. He believes that we need to move forward with this legislation, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act. We need to protect people's right to vote. It is a sacred right in this country. It's something that he intends to fight for. And if Republicans are going to choose not to come along, then that's something they're going to have to answer to their voters for. And I think that they're not going to like the answer that they get back. KARL: All right, Kate Bedingfield, White House communications director, thank you for joining us this morning. BEDINGFIELD: Thank you for having me, Jon. Appreciate it. KARL: All right, so let's take some of those questions right now to Republican senator from Alaska, Dan Sullivan. Senator Sullivan, thank you very much for joining us. I want to -- I know you just got back from the border. I want to ask you about that. But, first, let's pick it up with this question of voting rights. This new law in Georgia, and I know you're not from Georgia, but this is the -- this is a Republican law, you know, pushed through only by Republicans -- actually makes it a crime to give people food and water while they are waiting in line to vote. How -- how is something like that justifiable or -- or do you have problems with that? SEN. DAN SULLIVAN, (R) ALASKA: Well, look, Jon, good morning first and good to be on the show. And, you know, I don't know the details of the law in Georgia. There's been different interpretations by different groups. You know, I do know the details of the laws in Alaska. And when I was attorney general, as a U.S. senator, I've actually been a strong supporter, I've fought for expansive voting opportunities and rights, particularly for indigenous Alaskans, which is a huge minority group in my state. But I will tell you this, I think it's really important to have this discussion on voting rights, on voting integrity, on access to the ballot. But I think it's also really important if we're going to be bipartisan in this, is to be able to have this conversation without -- when anyone in the Congress -- that's us -- if we oppose what Speaker Pelosi is putting forward, that it immediately kind of devolves into an accusation that somehow we're supporting Jim Crow-like policies. That is an argument that is frequently coming from our Democratic colleagues, Speaker Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, even the president, and it doesn't help advance the issue. It doesn't help bring unity. It doesn't help bring a bipartisan nature to this. I'll just tell you, in my state -- KARL: But -- but -- SULLIVAN: Go -- I'm sorry, go ahead. KARL: But -- but -- but -- but -- but -- but to be clear, I mean, the law in Georgia, I mean this is -- there's not -- no question for interpretation. It makes it a misdemeanor offense to bring -- if you are not a poll worker, to bring people food and water while they are waiting in line. And, of course, we've seen very long lines in Georgia. And it's not just Georgia. There are efforts -- Republican-led efforts in 43 states to restrict voting in one way or another. Things like restricting the number of drop boxes, making it harder to vote absentee, restricting early voting. Why is it that Republicans seem to believe at this moment in time that -- that -- that they want fewer people to vote? That they -- that -- that their -- that the right thing to do is to have fewer people voting in our elections? SULLIVAN: Well, let me just make a point on -- on my state. In Alaska, a Republican state, we have policies like no excuse absentee ballots. In essence, automatic voter registration that is much more open to voters in Alaska. KARL: But it -- it -- SULLIVAN: Just, real quick. KARL: Yes. SULLIVAN: Than many blue states like New York, Delaware, Connecticut. So, again, we're not arguing that somehow relative to Alaska those are -- those states are pushing Jim Crow policies. But to your point, normally, in -- in -- you were talking about this with Kate, normally in our -- when you look at the history in our country, individual voting issues in states is not normally the reason that the impetus to bring major bipartisan, national federal legislation unless there is strong bipartisan support for this. And so I think that's the key issue. And, right now, H.R. 1, the Pelosi bill from the House, is -- not only doesn't have support from Republicans, it doesn't have support from many Democrats.  So, again, the key issue here is to work on this issue in a bipartisan nature.  You know, the last major voting reform bill... KARL:  Yes, I mean, no question, no question and -- I mean, this effort should be bipartisan, but the efforts we're seeing in the states are entirely partisan.  These are coming from Republicans.  Before we leave this topic, I just want to play something that Ben Ginsburg, who may be the leading Republican expert on voting laws, lawyer Ben Ginsburg had to say about these efforts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN GINSBERG, REPUBLICAN VOTING LAWS EXPERT:  I think they are making a mistake any time you put up barriers to people voting in a democracy.  Both on the policy grounds, because it's anti- the way the country should work, but also politically because it paints Republicans as truly not wanting people to vote. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  So I hear from what you're saying that you're not generally supportive of this idea of restricting.  So we can -- we can move on to your trip to the border.  You just came back from the border with Mexico.  Give me a sense of what you saw.  How are you seeing the problem down there? SULLIVAN:  Look, Jon, first, it's heartbreaking, what you see.  And it's shocking.  And what I've been calling for, in a respectful way, I try to work in a bipartisan way, is for the president, for the vice president to come down and to see what we saw, to hear what we heard from officials who are on the front lines.  But I would disagree with Kate on a number of things.  There is an open border policy.  There is a catch and release policy.  And these were changes that the Biden administration instituted. And here's the thing, they were warned.  We talked to the officials who briefed the Biden team during the transition.  They were warned that if they undertook these major policy changes, getting rid of, for example, the remain in Mexico policy, and making sure that exceptions to Title 42 for families bringing 6-year-olds or under, and for unaccompanied minors, if they made those changes, which they did, that they would see this surge. So to me it was shocking.  I think the president and the vice president need to go down there, see what I saw, see what the other Republicans and Democrat congressmen are coming down there.  There are things that we can do immediately to address the challenges there.  But right now it is open borders.  It's a humanitarian and also health crisis that we need to address. KARL:  Well, I mean, the numbers from CBP showed that actually the majority of adults crossing the border are being sent back. But before you go, I want to ask you about something we heard from former President Trump talking about January 6th, and about the efforts from the Justice Department to -- to hold those accountable that invaded the Capitol.  He said that the members of that -- of those rioters are, quote, ""being persecuted."" Is that -- is that how you see it, this DoJ effort to -- you know, to charge the people that went into the Capitol?  Is that persecution or is that rightful prosecution? SULLIVAN:  No.  Look, Jon, I don't agree with that.  Here's the key issue, and it's a really important distinction.  The people who committed violence, and I condemn that violence from the minute it started happening, should be fully prosecuted.  I think the vast majority of Americans, Democrats and Republicans fully agree with that.  No doubt about it.  I've condemned it. The broader issue though is if you -- if you were at the broader rally, the vast majority of the people at the rally on January 6th did not commit violence, did not storm the Capitol, and I think it's really important.  By the way, I had a lot of Alaskans who were there acting peacefully. KARL:  Sure. SULLIVAN:  I think it's really important for people who came to support that rally that they are not tarnished, canceled, their voices shouldn't be silenced.  So I think it's two very different issues here. KARL:  We're talking about the people that went into the Capitol. Now before you go, the president has also said that he is going to work hard to defeat your colleague, your Republican colleague from Alaska, Lisa Murkowski.  In fact, the Alaska Republican Party has actually not only censured her, but called for her to be defeated.  What -- I know you have a -- I've always thought, it seems, you have a good relationship with Senator Murkowski.  What do you make of those efforts by President Trump and your own party leadership in Alaska to see her defeated? SULLIVAN:  Well, look, when I ran in 2014 and beat a Democrat incumbent and we got the Senate majority back, Senator Murkowski was a strong supporter of mine.  And in 2016 I supported her.  And just in my re-election in 2020, where, you know, the national Democratic Party came in big in Alaska, massive amount of money, Senator Murkowski was a strong supporter of mine and we won that re-election very strongly.  Look, we don't agree on everything, but we make a good team for Alaska and... KARL:  So you support her?  You support her. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  If Senator Murkowski runs again, I'm going to support her. KARL:  OK.  Thank you very much, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, appreciate you joining us. SULLIVAN:  Thanks, Jon.  Thank you. KARL:  Up next, more fallout over that controversial new election law in Georgia.  Nate Silver has a fresh take for us.  And the Powerhouse Roundtable is here with us to weigh in.  We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  With Senate Bill 202, Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair. Ensuring the integrity of the ballot box isn't partisan. It's about protecting the very foundation of who we are as Georgians and Americans. SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA):  Either we're a democracy or we're not. Either we believe in the idea of one person, one vote, or we don't. Either I'm a citizen or I'm not. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  Dueling reactions to Georgia's new voting law. It comes in the wake of a presidential election that saw the largest turnout in more than a century. But after then President Trump spent months making false claims of election fraud, Republican lawmakers across the country are now rushing to enact new restrictions on voting. FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver analyzes the potential impact. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATE SILVER, ABC NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:  There's a reason why, historically, Republicans have tried to make it harder for people to vote. Looking at changes in state voting laws since the 1990s, our research at FiveThirtyEight found that, in general, when voting laws are eased, it tends to help Democrats, and when they are restricted, it tends to help Republicans. Based on the historical data, imposing a sweeping set of new restrictions might help a Republican candidate by as much as 2 to 3 percentage points in forthcoming elections. That's significant, given how close many elections are these days. But, as they warn you when you're buying stocks, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That might also be the case when it comes to voting laws. Here's why. Before Trump, the GOP tended to win the votes of so-called high-propensity voters, meaning people who voted in nearly every election. These voters tended to be suburban and college-educated. But, lately, those voters have been leaning more Democratic, especially in states like Georgia, where Joe Biden deep front by 15 points among college grads. So, we can no longer assume lower turnout always helps the GOP. In the Georgia Senate run-off, where turnout was 10 percent lower than in November, Democratic performance actually improved. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to reduce mail-in voting in several states, but in 2020, it was a new maybe COVID-related phenomenon. In Florida, for example, mail voting had historically been a program that Republican voters took more advantage of. With that said, I don't want to take this too far. A lot of GOP changes are aimed at hampering turnout among black voters by limiting programs like Souls to the Polls. So, my advice, it will probably make life harder for Democrats, but there's a chance it could backfire. (END VIDEOTAPE) KARL:  Thanks, Nate. Now let's get to our roundtable. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel; Margaret Hoover, the host of “The Firing Line” on PBS, also a CNN contributor; Ramesh Ponnuru, Bloomberg Opinion columnist, and senior editor at “The National Review”; and Leah Wright-Rigueur, professor of history at Brandeis University. So, let me -- let me start with you, Ramesh. What -- help me understand why these in Georgia -- why make it a crime. The question I asked to Senator Sullivan, why make it a crime to give people water while they're waiting in line to vote? I mean, what's the political strategy here? RAMESH PONNURU, BLOOMBERG OPINION COLUMNIST:  So that's clearly the provision of the law that has aroused the most outrage, and it seems to be designed to mimic parts of other states' codes where they're trying to prevent electioneering going in the voting booth or near the voting booth. It was not a particularly well-drafted section of this law, but the fundamental issue here I think is -- it's not whether we're bringing food and water to people in these long lines. It's why are we having these long lines in the first place? And the Georgia law does take some steps to shorten those lines. It increases the amount of absentee voting, the number of hours, the number of days that you can do absentee voting, for example, and that is where I think our focus ought to be. KARL:  So, Leah, I mean, you heard the terms Senator Warnock is talking about this. He basically makes it sound like it's, you know, a challenge to our democracy. How -- what makes this Georgia law so bad aside from the water? LEAH WRIGHT-RIGUEUR, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I mean, aside from the water? KARL:  Yeah, that's bad. OK, I’m going to buy that. But what is most objectionable here? WRIGHT-RIGUEUR:  The biggest part that we have to be thinking about is in a moment where we should be expanding democracy, a moment where we should be including more people in the democratic process, where we've seen what is possible, what is potential when we actually expand democracy for everyone, right? This constitutionally guaranteed right of voting, the most sacred of rights, of voting, we have this draconian law that's coming down and essentially saying, none for you, none for you, none for you. And I think it comes at the heels of an election that was transformative when we think about what happened in Georgia, turning Georgia blue, flipping Georgia blue, and then also when we see the two senators coming out of Georgia are now Democratic senators. The first time this has happened in over 30 years. So I think when we think about what is at stake here, we're thinking about democracy. We're thinking about the fundamental principles of democracy, and all of that is up for grabs right now, and I think it also sends a message I think to other states across the country about what could happen in terms of limiting democracy for all. KARL:  Rahm, but what is it that is the most objectionable here? RAHM EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  What is the most objectionable? KARL:  Specifically. EMANUEL:  But it’s both political and policy. Look, I don't think America really became a fully democratic country until the Voting Rights Act, when everybody could participate. If you buy that principle, everything since Bush versus Gore, redistricting, dark money, restricting access to voting, I think all of that is about contracting and walking away. I think when you go back to Justice Roberts' decision that we -- striking Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Those words are going to haunt, and that's exactly what happened, it opened up the floodgates where everybody basically walked away from the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This is about power. And I think when you go back to this access, which is both about access to the ballot, about making sure -- redistricting which is also part of HR-1, which is about making sure that the legislators do not actually design the districts. You put it in commission, and a lot of different Democratic and Republican states have done it, and then dark money. What you're doing is bringing integrity to the entire electoral process. Not just -- voting is important. The lines are important, and then money is important. And that is why HR-1 is right. MARGARET HOOVER, HOST, PBS “FIRING LINE:  Can I just say? Neither of our guests, respectfully, have been able to say specifically what's wrong with the Georgia law except for the 150-foot law and the water, which everybody admits is terrible optics. It gets rid of signature match. It expands early voting, it didn't think, God, get rid of the Souls to the Polls, the Sunday voting. It expanded Saturday and Sunday voting. This bill -- the Republicans who stood up to Donald Trump and argued against the big lie and said, nope, I’m not going to find 11,800 votes for you because that would be lying, and the undermining of the Constitution, those same people say, you know what? I might have written a better bill, but this is administrative changes codifying the things that expanded the franchise in this last election and putting them into law. EMANUEL:  Both of us were done respectfully as guests here. KARL: Yes. EMANUEL: They're all for guests. KARL: Yes. EMANUEL: But here's the thing, if Trump had won Georgia, you think they'd be doing this? It's a simple task (ph). Do you think if -- here's -- if Georgia was a -- HOOVER: That's fair, but what is so wrong with this particular law? EMANUEL: wait a second, wait a second, Georgia was the best, respectfully -- respectfully, do you think Georgia was the best performing Democratic state from -- it flipped from red to blue from 2016 to 2020, two Democratic senators and a pickup of a congressional seat. KARL: Well -- well, and -- EMANUEL: And the reason Georgia's the first out of the shoot and doing this is because it acted -- HOOVER: Because it's a big lie. Fair. EMANUEL: No -- right -- right. But if Trump had won, none of this would be going on. And so when you say, oh, there's nothing wrong with the -- the Georgia law is about restricting Democratic process, and that is what's -- every time America has achieved closer to its ideals, although never perfect, was about actually, from women voting, to people of color voting, to -- and making sure that people without -- KARL: It -- it -- WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: But we've been hearing -- EMANUEL: Without land could vote. It actually expanded the democratic process. This is restricting it. We've constantly -- KARL: Ramesh, go ahead. PONNURU: We've been hearing for years that Republicans are restricting voter access. There's a vote to (INAUDIBLE). And turnout just keeps getting higher. I think that one thing -- KARL: Well, we had record turnout now. PONNURU: Yes. KARL: And now you have all these efforts, which are more than what we've seen in the past. EMANUEL: Restrictive. KARL: And it -- and we are seeing -- and let me throw a couple things out there. It's, like, limiting the number of drop boxes and, you know, and these -- these are efforts we're seeing in several states. PONNURU: Georgia's going to have more drop box access than it had in 2019, right? I mean there is a -- a scale back from the pandemic circumstances, but this is not this draconian, restrictive law. HOOVER: And they wrote it into the statute for the first time. Like it had never even been legal in the statute to have these voting drop boxes. Now they've codified it. So while it is -- KARL: But -- but the whole effort -- and it's not just Georgia. We're -- we're seeing -- we're seeing several other states. HOOVER: Well, that's different. So -- so talking about Georgia, right -- KARL: But why -- why -- I mean what's the problem with drop boxes? The problem is that President Trump frankly said -- told lies about drop boxes. HOOVER: And -- and -- and you're right. KARL: (INAUDIBLE) -- HOOVER: Jonathan, you're right, there -- there absolutely is, on behalf -- and I'm never going to defend Republicans who want to restrict voting access. I believe more and more people should vote, and that is expanding franchise is, look, a successful party would just appeal to more voters, OK? That's what I want the Republican Party to do. KARL: Which is -- which is not what we're hearing across the country. HOOVER: Which is not what you're hearing universally. But the problem is, this issue is also so vitriolic, so hyperbolic that you can't actually have a conversation about the planks in the Georgia law without just going immediately to, they want all people to stop voting. EMANUEL: Yes, but you do have this -- you know, I think -- I -- the lawyer for the Republican National Committee said it in the Arizona case, politics is a zero sum game. And the motivation for having an opinion, and issuing an opinion on what's going on in Arizona was because if you had more people vote, they would lose. And so that's why I think when it also comes up to try to pass this in the Senate, you have three different sections. And the real question is, there's going to be a Republican that becomes the Senator Everett Dirksen of 1964 here that says, you know what, this is about America and about the Democratic process. Now, I think Republicans have a point on the integrity of the ballot, Democrats have a view about the voter access. That should be where the bond is built. And also getting to -- KARL: Is that -- is it possible to get to a bipartisan agreement on this? The question I was getting to Kate. And she says, well, ask the Republicans. But this is -- I mean you have these entirely partisan efforts in the states by Republicans, and then in Congress by the Democrats. I'm not equating the two efforts, but, I mean, if anything has to be bipartisan, it's -- it's how we conduct our elections. WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: (INAUDIBLE). It should absolutely be how we conduct our elections. And I think there is an opportunity right here that's in Congress right now, in front of people, to talk about this kind of bipartisan effort to expand the franchise, to make the franchise equitable and fair for everyone, to make it more exclusive, to make this about big party, big tent politics as opposed to restrictive. So we do see that. And I do -- you know, one of the things that I'm -- that I'm heartened by is that even as we argue over the semantics of what's going on in Georgia, there is an increasing recognition that the end of the Voting Rights Act, the gutting of the Voting Rights Act was a terrible decision, right? And that, in fact, there has to be some way to rectify this and it has to be something that has to be bipartisan, and it has to be something that comes at a federal level. Like, it can't be state and local. KARL: Same question to you, Ramesh. PONNURU: Well, one bipartisan initiative is voter ID requirements. Pew found that 76 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, supports voter ID requirements. Now, I think that should be coupled with efforts to make it possible for anybody whose having trouble getting voter ID to get it. And Georgia does offers voter ID for free for people. But that is something that Democrats have gotten dead set against. There's not much evidence -- KARL: You're not helping me try to figure out where we're going to get to a bipartisan agreement in Congress. HOOVER: H.R. 4. Here's where you're going to get to H.R. 4. First of all, like, H.R. 4, which is -- which is the legislative answer. It's a restoration of the voting rights and it's the answer to Shelby v. Holder, right? That is a more narrow restoration of the Voting Right Act, as Rahm said, that isn't this sort of gargantuan, you know, we're also going to fix dark money and politics and we're also going to do all these other things. If you -- and, also, are -- are -- do we need 50 votes or do we need 60 votes? I mean all of this is shaded by the debate about the filibuster. KARL: All right, well that's a whole nother question. HOOVER: And what the rules are going to be. KARL: We have to take a quick break. We have to take a quick break. Maybe we can get to that on the other side. More roundtable ahead. But up next, Dr. Ashish Jha joins us to talk about getting back to normal as COVID vaccines pick up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KARL:  Dr. Ashish Jha is standing by, ready to go.  We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people's arms in my first 100 days.  Now today I'm setting a second goal, and that is we will by my 100th day in office have administered 200 million shots in people's arms.  That's right, 200 million shots in 100 days. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  President Biden's latest vaccine pledge. Let's talk about the rollout now with Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health. Dr. Jha, I just want to ask you some practical questions, now that so many of us are getting the vaccines. One that I'm hearing a lot is:  Once I am fully vaccinated, if I'm exposed to COVID-19, I am protected from getting sick myself, but can I infect somebody else? DR. ASHISH JHA, DEAN, BROWN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH:  Yes, good morning, Jon. Thanks so much for having me on. You know, what we know right now is, if you are exposed after full vaccination, you're very, very, very unlikely to get sick, and you're pretty unlikely to transmit it to others. I mean, that transmission data isn't foolproof yet, but all the evidence so far suggests that your likelihood of passing it on to somebody else is -- you know, it's probably down 80, 90 percent, compared if you weren't vaccinated. KARL:  OK, so let me ask you one really close to home, OK? If my in-laws, just hypothetically, were fully vaccinated, been through full dose, both doses, can -- and, you know, the rest of the family is, say, on the first dose, but not fully through, can we go and safely visit them? And are there any special precautions we need to take, or are we pretty safe in doing that? JHA:  Yes, I think you're pretty safe. As long as there's no one in your family, Jonathan, who is particularly high-risk, no one with a severe health problem, I think it is safe. And the CDC has come out and said as much. I think the bottom line that people have to know is that we're not going to get to zero risk. But, at that point, when people are fully vaccinated, mingling with a family that's not, there's really a very, very low risk that anything bad is going to happen. KARL:  So, let me ask you, then, about something that President Biden said a while back. He was talking about July 4, and, you know, obviously the goal of having much of the country vaccinated by then. And he invoked the idea that we'll be able to have small family gatherings, barbecues in the backyard, small gatherings, family. I mean, at that point, if we're really fully vaccinated, I mean, can't we be doing more than just having family over in the backyard? Aren't we looking at a wider opening? JHA:  So, I do think we're looking at a wider opening. I think the question is, will everything be safe? Will everything that we used to do in 2019 be safe? And my take is, even by July 4, my expectation is that some proportion of Americans will have chosen not to get vaccinated, so they're still going to be at risk. And we probably should avoid those sort of large indoor gatherings, where we know the virus tends to spread more efficiently. But, short of that, yes, I do think we can do a lot more. It's not just small family gatherings. We can friends over. We can have probably larger gatherings indoors, especially if everybody is vaccinated. KARL:  All right. Dr. Jha, thank you very much for joining us. Coming up:  Calls for gun control are back front and center following the back-to-back shootings in Atlanta and Boulder. But will anything get done this time? The roundtable returns. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What this isn't about is policy. It's about stopping sensible gun legislation which a vast majority of Americans support. And I have no illusions about what we’re up against, what we’re up against or how hard the task is in front of us, but I also have never seen a nation's conscience so shaken by what happened at Sandy Hook. I don't to need to wait another minute, let alone an hour to take common sense steps that will save the lives in the future. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  There you have it. President Biden at the center of the gun debate for decades. Let's pick it up here with the roundtable. Rahm, what is your sense this time? I mean, is it -- where does this stand in the president's priority list? EMANUEL:  Oh, it's high. That's how I got to know Joe Biden when we passed the assault weapon ban. I was responsible for President Clinton and doing that, and the Brady Bill. Both of those. And I would say one thing that I think would slightly twist -- and that's for all of us discussing -- back then when we passed the two-crime pieces, Brady Bill, the assault weapon ban, we focused on the gun -- on the criminal, not the gun. Now we're focusing on the gun. I would go back to terrorists, no fly, no buy. Cannot happen. Two, you have a domestic violence record, which is 10 percent of all homicides in America, you're banned from buying a gun. You have a violent criminal record as a juvenile, you can’t buy a gun. You have a mental health issue, and the relationship and anything on violence, on mental health, you can't buy a gun. If you focus on the criminal piece, not access to the gun, Republicans then realize it's not about gun access which would have obviously Second Amendment issue, but the criminal element which is how Clinton focused on both Brady with the five-day waiting period for a criminal could -- background check, and the assault weapon which was also a gun of choice by gangs. KARL:  But that was about the gun. It was about the assault weapon. EMANUEL:  No. If you actually go back to the debate -- sorry, let -- KARL: But the effect was to ban assault-style weapons. It was for everybody. EMANUEL: But it was -- it was -- it was basically to make sure that gang members did not -- that was the problem then. And it was focused on the criminal element. If you want to pass it, and you've got to deal -- get Republican votes, no fly, no buy. KARL: OK. So -- EMANUEL: You prove an old mental -- HOOVER: It sounds like you're saying -- it sounds like you're saying guns don't kill people, people kill people. EMANUEL: No, but I'm saying that if you go back to the debate -- HOOVER: No, no, no. I understand what you're saying, it's just that was the NRA tag line for so long. EMANUEL: Yes, no, I'll tell you -- and I -- I -- no, it's not. I mean, trust me, no friend there. It's very specifically -- HOOVER: And they're essentially gone now. (INAUDIBLE) different now. EMANUEL: But given -- given that you're never -- your -- Republicans are not going to vote for this. You have to get the access. The debate back in the '90s, the last time we passed it, was on the criminal element. That's where the debate should be. (INAUDIBLE). KARL: OK, so -- so -- obviously what's -- what's -- EMANUEL: And I want to be clear, Proud Boys are on a domestic terrorist list. KARL: What -- what's driving it here, though, is -- are -- are the mass shootings. And -- and, Ramesh, I want to put up this -- this list of some of the -- the most high profile mass shootings we have seen over the last several years. You know, Boulder, Midland-Odessa, Dayton, on through Parkland, Las Vegas, Orlando, Aurora, Sandy Hook. Each one of those, the gun used by the mass murderer was an AR-15. Why -- why shouldn't banning that weapon be on -- on the table? PONNURU: Well, I think that it is going to be very hard to get any kind of bipartisan consensus on that. I think some of the ideas that Rahm Emanuel was talking about might have some legs. But this is an idea, banning assault weapons, that got 39 votes in the Senate the last time it was voted on. A Democratic Senate in 2013, a Senate with more Democrats than the current Senate has. I think most people don't believe that a ban on assault weapons is going to do a lot to change the homicide rates in our country. We've got something like 15 million of them already in circulation. So I think there's a practical question as to whether this is going to actually achieve anything. And I think that other things, like, for example, as -- as Rahm was saying, talking about people with mental illness, particularly severe mental illness, people who have histories of abuse, that kind of more granular approach, I think, makes more sense. EMANUEL: We -- WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: Yes. So I was also going to say that I think there are two other issues that we have to address, which is that in addition to these mass shootings, which generate the most attention, we also know that we have a crisis of individual or micro-level homicides, shootings, suicides that are prevalent throughout the country and so there has to be -- KARL: And actually kill many more people. WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: And kill many more people. And so not only do we have to have -- draw attention to that, we also have to have the science that backs this up. The other thing right now is that right now states -- the majority of states can't even control, I think, on a local level how they want to do their own laws and legislations, in part because of obstructionism by various lobbying groups and organizations and things of that nature. So we have to figure out ways to give states power -- give -- and I can't believe I'm making what -- what sounds like a local control argument. KARL: States' rights. WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: Why? Republican -- yes, right, Republicans are really happy about that. EMANUEL: It's liberating. WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: But -- but we have to give states' power back to make local control laws and regulations so that if they want to, like in the case of Colorado, in the case of Boulder, for example, if they want to pass legislation, they can do that and have the freedom to do that. KARL: All right. Unfortunately, Rahm, I see your shaking your head, but we are out of time. EMANUEL: That is true (ph). KARL: That is all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out WORLD NEWS TONIGHT and have a great day. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)"
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kate-bedingfield-calls-migrant-surge-cyclical-issue/story?id=76725635,politics,Kate Bedingfield calls migrant surge a 'cyclical issue',"White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield dismissed the record surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S./Mexico border as a ""cyclical issue"" and denied that it is worse than any other time in history. ""These are the same kind of surges that we've seen,"" Bedingfield told ABC's ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday. ""They're not the result of one administration's policies or another administration's policies. They're the result of, for example, weather disasters in the region. They're the result of people fleeing poverty and violence."" A Border Patrol official   that in the past month, they've stopped an average of 5,000 people a day and are expecting that number to grow as the summer months near. As of Thursday, 18,046 unaccompanied minors were in the custody of Customs and Border Protection and Health and Human Services, skyrocketing by nearly 1,000 compared to the previous day. Bedingfield said Sunday that the administration is working to speed up the amount of time children are being held in CBP custody, because many are spending longer than the legally allowed 72 hours inside the cramped, temporary facilities. Images released by CBP last week   at a facility in Donna, Texas. Children are sleeping on gym mats, huddled under foil blankets and separated by plastic. It's only supposed to hold 250 people, but there are thousands inside. The White House has not granted media access to these detention-like facilities. ""The president is working as quickly as possible to move them into facilities that are acceptable,"" Bedingfield told Karl, adding that the administration has opened up space at Fort Bliss and Lackland Air Force Base to house unaccompanied minors. ""It's a temporary solution. Ultimately, what we need to do is address the root causes of migration,"" she added. The administration is struggling to balance its message that the U.S.-Mexico border is ""closed,"" while also openly acknowledging that they will not turn away children who arrive alone. But Bedingfield reinforced to Karl that the White House's message has ""been very clear"" that the border is not open. ""This is not the moment to do it. This is not the time to do it. The border is closed,"" she said. A new   released Sunday morning shows that 57% of Americans disapprove of the president's approach to the surge of migrants. Republicans have seized on this moment to criticize the administration and a large delegation of U.S. senators   this past week, characterizing the situation as a crisis. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was part of the Republican delegation and told Karl in a separate interview on ""This Week"" that what he saw was ""shocking"" and ""heartbreaking."" ""I've been calling for, in a respectful way, I try to work in a bipartisan way, is for the president, for the vice president, to come down and to see what we saw, to hear what we heard from officials who are on the front lines,"" he said. GOP lawmakers aren't alone -- the   also found 54% of Americans view this as a crisis and another 42% believe it's a serious problem, but not a crisis. Bedingfield told Karl that this is an area where both Republicans and Democrats have historically shared a desire to work together and that ""this is a moment for Republicans to come to the table, to work with us on comprehensive immigration reform."" Another battle the White House is facing comes from Georgia, the state that delivered Democrats control of the Senate. Gov. Brian Kemp   a new election law that limits ballot drop boxes, adds new requirements for mail-in voting and makes it a crime for anyone other than a poll worker to offer food and water to voters waiting in line. On Friday, Biden called the new law ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century,"" "" ,"" and ""un-American."" ""The idea that you need to suppress the vote or prevent people in this country from voting in order to win, I mean, it truly runs counter to everything that we believe as Americans,"" Bedingfield told Karl Sunday. Biden said on Friday that his administration is working to figure out how to respond -- with the Department of Justice reviewing the law as well -- but ""don't know quite exactly what we can do at this point."" Bedingfield reiterated the administration's support for the House-passed   and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, but pressed by Karl if Biden has a way to bring Senate Republicans around on these bills, Bedingfield said ""that's a question best left to them."" ""Are they going to look their constituents in the eye and say, 'I spent my time in Washington trying to make it harder for you to cast your vote?'"" Bedingfield said. ""Is that really the argument that they want to take back to their constituents?"""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/patrolling-rio-grande-migrant-crossings-reporters-notebook/story?id=76725190,politics,Patrolling the Rio Grande for migrant crossings: Reporter's Notebook,"I was out with Texas State troopers onboard a tactical marine boat as they patrolled the Rio Grande on Friday. Staff Lt. Ivan Tijerina told me and those I was with that the troopers haven't seen a surge in migrants like the one underway now in years and, notably, he's never seen so many unaccompanied minors crossing the border. ""We've seen everything from empty one-gallon jugs made into makeshift rafts to 55-gallon drums. They make them into makeshift rafts -- mattresses, you name it. Whatever can float,"" he said. Crossing the river is perilous and sometimes deadly. In 2019, a viral photo of father Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his toddler daughter Valeria lying face down after drowning in the Rio Grande highlighted the risk migrants take. On March 20, a U.S. Border Patrol Marine Unit was flagged down to help three unresponsive migrants stranded on an island in the Rio Grande. The Guatemalan woman and her 3-year-old son, a Mexican national, survived. But her 9-year-old daughter, also a Mexican national, later died. On the Rio Grande, I spotted several makeshift rafts tangled in trees along the edge of the river -- troopers hopped on and off, puncturing the rafts so they couldn't be used again. According to the Missing Migrants Project, 76 migrants have died at the U.S.-Mexico border so far this year. The organization, which tracks deaths of migrants who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide, also reports the top causes of migrant deaths along the border in 2020 include being shot and killed, vehicle accidents and drowning. ""A lot of times smugglers, they're called coyotes -- will bring them to the river and then say 'OK from here, that's it.' It's on your own, you cross and then leave them out here,"" Tijerina said. ""It becomes dangerous for them because they don't know that terrain. Terrain like this is very thick and vegetation, people can get lost and get hurt. You got venomous snakes, you have, you know, animals, and once they get hurt. It's very hard for somebody to get help."" In the past 30 days,   authorities at the southern border have stopped an average of 5,000 unauthorized immigrants a day, about half of whom are family members and unaccompanied minors, according to a senior Border Patrol official. But with the surge in migrants, Tijerina told us some are easily finding a way around authorities. ""One of our main challenges, we'll have some marine units out along areas on the river. The water's too shallow where we cannot patrol, and of course those areas are easily exploited because we can't reach there and depends on the accessibility of the land. That's easy to be exploited and used for human trafficking, as well as narcotics trafficking,"" Tijerina said. While we were out on the water, troopers spotted a car with its doors open -- a sign of an imminent crossing. By the time they doubled back, the car left to find another spot on the river that was not as well covered."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bipartisanship-key-successful-voting-reform-gop-sen-dan/story?id=76725701,politics,Bipartisanship key to successful voting reform: GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan,"Bipartisan efforts are the key to successful voting rights reform, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" as hopes for reaching across the aisle in Congress falter and calls for removing the filibuster grow louder. ""I think it's really important to have this discussion on voting rights, on voting integrity, on access to the ballot,"" Sullivan told ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. But Sullivan said a bipartisan conversation surrounding voting rights is difficult right now because when someone in Congress has opposed H.R. 1, the Democrats' bill on the issue, it turns into ""an accusation that somehow we're supporting Jim Crow-like policies."" ""It doesn't help advance the issue. It doesn't help bring unity. It doesn't help bring a bipartisan nature to this,"" he continued. Pushing the   -- which seeks to abolish hurdles to voting, reform the role of money in politics and tighten federal ethics rules -- congressional Democrats are trying to   in Republican-led state legislatures to   in the name of security after many in the GOP, led by former President Donald Trump, pushed false election theories following the 2020 election. In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill Thursday that will make sweeping changes to election law, impacting voters, local election administrators and the board overseeing elections. Karl pressed Sullivan on the efforts in 43 states to restrict access to the ballot. ""Why is it that Republicans seem to believe, at this moment in time, that they want fewer people to vote -- that the right thing to do is to have fewer people voting in our elections?"" he asked. Sullivan dodged Karl's question, but said that it is unusual for federal voting reform to become an issue of contention, given that the administration of elections is historically left to the states. ""When you look at the history in our country, individual voting issues in states is not normally the reason -- the impetus -- to bring major bipartisan national federal legislation, unless there is strong bipartisan support for this,"" he said. ""And so I think that's the key issue in right now, H.R.1, the Pelosi bill from the House, not only doesn't have support from Republicans, it doesn't have support from many Democrats. So again the key issue here is to work on this issue in a bipartisan nature."" Sullivan said immigration reform is another issue which warrants bipartisan negotiation and responded to   the crisis at the southern border by White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield, who said in an earlier interview on ""This Week"" that Biden has made clear the borders are closed for the time being. Following a recent trip to the southern border with much of the Senate GOP conference, he said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris need to go and ""see what we saw, to hear what we heard from officials who are on the front lines."" ""But right now it is open borders,"" Sullivan said. ""It's a humanitarian, and public health crisis that we need to address."" Karl also asked the senator about the fallout from the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, as federal authorities continue to prosecute those who took part in that violence by storming the building. Trump recently said that he felt those in attendance were being ""persecuted."" ""Is this DOJ effort to charge the people that went into the Capitol, is that -- is that persecution or is that rightful prosecution?"" he asked. Sullivan disagreed with the characterization from the former president, but said that he believes it is important that those who were in attendance and were peaceful not have their reputations ""tarnished."" ""Here's the key issue, and it's a really important distinction: The people who committed violence -- and I condemned that violence from the minute it started happening -- should be fully prosecuted,"" Sullivan said. ""I think the vast majority of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, fully agree with that, no doubt about it."" The violence that day ultimately led to the House of Representatives pursuing a charge of incitement of insurrection against Trump, which led to the most bipartisan impeachment vote in history. The measure failed in the Senate, but Sullivan's home state colleague, moderate Sen. Lisa Murkowski, voted to impeach the president. Her vote led to a censure at home by the Alaska GOP and a vow from Trump and the state party that they would   when she up for reelection next year. Sullivan said he will support her when she is on the ballot again. ""Sen. Murkowski was a strong supporter of mine and we won that reelection, very strongly,"" Sullivan said of his campaign last year. ""Look we don't agree on everything, but we make a good team for Alaska,"" he added. ""If Sen. Murkowski runs again, I'm going to support her."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cdc-extends-eviction-moratorium-late-june/story?id=76751761,politics,CDC extends eviction moratorium until late June,"Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has signed an extension on the agency's moratorium on evictions through June 30, further preventing the eviction of tenants who are unable to make rental payments, the   Monday. The order was set to end March 31, but the CDC's move gives renters 90 more days of relief it in the interest of public   amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the second time that Walensky has extended the order to stop evictions during the pandemic. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a historic threat to the nation’s public health,"" Walenskey said in a statement. ""Keeping people in their homes and out of crowded or congregate settings — like homeless shelters — by preventing evictions is a key step in helping to stop the spread of COVID-19."" The CDC previously cited outbreaks in homeless shelters as cautionary tales about the danger the communal spaces can pose during the pandemic. The CDC also previously cited data from the Census Bureau's   that said that 32% of renters indicated they would move in with family or friends if evicted, which could pose spread within households. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also extended a moratorium on evictions in federally assisted housing until June 30. Secretary for Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge discussed the move in a White House press briefing last week. ""Many of the people living in federally-assisted housing have risk factors that make them particularly vulnerable to COVID. These factors include disability, race, and low-income, along with racial and ethnic disparities in access to response, care, and treatment. We’re making sure that federal, state, and local efforts to reach those most at-risk of COVID are linking those efforts to people living in housing HUD supports,"" Fudge said. ""The American Rescue Plan is critical to our success in these efforts."" Fudge discussed the rates of homelessness on  , which a report by HUD found were up 2% in 2020, a statistic that does not reflect the impact of the pandemic. ""I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it. I mean, when we have people who are literally living on the streets, in those numbers, in an extraordinary circumstance, such as COVID, we know that it's going to get worse. What we're trying to do now is make sure that we can cut it off before it gets any worse. That is why it is so significant that we can help cities and communities find housing for people who are most at risk of contracting COVID in the first place."" Funds in the president's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package allocated more than $21 billion in assistance to renters. White House press secretary Jen Psaki discussed the move during a press briefing Monday and discussed rental assistance funds. ""The president is committed to supporting renters and small landlords through the COVID-19 crisis, essential to that effort is of course the American Rescue Plan, which delivers an additional $21.5 billion in emergency rental assistance to help millions of families keep up on rent and remain in their homes,"" Psaki said."

Qualified immunity is the practice of not being able to file a civil lawsuit against a government official performing his or her official duties unless they ""clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known."" In New York, the City Council voted to end the practice for   officers. The NYPD is the   in the United States, with some 36,000 officers. The move came days ahead of the start of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's  . The   while in police custody sparked international protests and a debate over policing reform across the U.S. last summer. In an interview on WNYC's ""The Brian Lehrer Show,"" Mayor Bill DeBlasio stressed that the bill won't have officers personally responsible. ""It makes it easier if someone has a concern to bring a legal action, but it does not put the individual financial penalty on the officer,"" the mayor said. ""It puts it on the department and the city, and that's what I was comfortable with."" City Council speaker Corey Johnson lauded the move saying that the practice of qualified immunity   the nation's systemic racism. ""Qualified immunity was established in 1967 in Mississippi to prevent Freedom Riders from holding public officials liable even when they broke the law,"" Johnson tweeted. ""Rooted in our nation's history of systemic racism, qualified immunity denied Freedom Riders justice and has been used to deny justice to victims of police abuse for decades. It should never have been allowed, but I'm proud that we took action today to end it here in NYC."" Police union officials are speaking out against the law, which the mayor signaled he intended to sign. ""Qualified immunity is an essential part of the law enforcement profession. While it shields officers from erroneous and professionally damaging lawsuits, it does not erase responsibility. At any point in time, an agency determines the office was acting out of policy or unlawfully, qualified immunity could be removed and them exposed to full liability,"" Don Mihalek, an ABC News contributor said. ""The public often confuses lawful actions by law enforcement versus public perception. What is lawful may not be clear in the public's view. This is why an investigation is paramount to document the lawfulness of an officer's actions,"" said Mihalek, who also serves as the executive director of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/targeted-violence-schools-preventable-secret-service-report/story?id=76755511,politics, 'Targeted violence' against schools preventable: Secret Service report,"Targeted violence against schools is preventable, if the warning signs are identified, according to a new report by the Secret Service released Tuesday. The report by the Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center studied 67 thwarted school violence plots and 100 plotters to come up with a framework to further  . The agency found that there were   in attacks that were prevented and attacks that happened, such as a history of discipline or law enforcement interaction, if the plotter had experienced bullying or had underlying mental health issues, intended to commit suicide or had been impacted by childhood conditions. Schools should intervene as quickly as possible, according to the Secret Service. Dr. Lina Althari, director of the Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center, told ABC News that identifying warning signs of a student who could potentially carry out a mass attack is crucial in getting the student help. ""We want to make sure that we are identifying these kids before it gets to the level where they are engaging in criminal actions, and then face legal consequences for that,"" she said. ""We want to make sure we're catching them early on when maybe they are becoming more depressed, they are becoming more suicidal."" The Secret Service found that 45% of the attacks planned, but not carried out, were based on a grievance with a classmate. It also found that 15% of potential attackers wanted to kill. For example, according to authorities Matthew Vanderbeek threatened to shoot up his graduation ceremony in 2018. Vanderbeek wanted to emulate the 2012 Aurora, Colorado,   that killed 12, according to the Secret Service, even going so far as dyeing his hair to match that of the convicted gunman and advocating for his release from prison. Students are best positioned to report any concerning behavior of a classmate, the report said, but families are critical to identifying troubling behavior. In the foiled plots studied by the Secret Service, 69% of the communications about the plans were observed by students, classmates or peers. Often times, when reported early, student plotters are able to seek treatment rather than criminal prosecution, Althari said. ""Sometimes we know parents can be in denial,"" Althari said. ""But if it is swiftly explained to them what the goal of this process is which is about helping that student have successful outcomes in life."" The report also found that 64% of the student attack plotters had access to firearms and 15 of the foiled plots were set to be conducted on dates in April -- likely because of the Columbine High School shooting, which occurred on  . The Secret Service found that in nearly half of the planned plots, one or more of the co-conspirators had interest in the 1998 shooting at Columbine. And of the school attackers who planned but did not carry out the attack, 85% either researched how to obtain or obtained weapons. And in nearly all of the attacks, the plotter planned to use firearms in the attack itself and 51% had planned to use explosives. The report indicated that 75% of the plotters were discovered because they communicated their intent and most behaviors were observed and reported on the same day. In one instance, a 17-year-old male was reported to police by a friend after he indicated he wanted to carry out a school shooting. ""The plotter created cellphone videos in which he discussed his plot, stating he would kill more people than Columbine, Virginia Tech or the attack in Oslo, Norway,"" the report says. ""The plotter spoke about purchasing an AK-17 with a laser sight, told him that he perfected a timer for bombs and showed him a map of schools."" A majority of the plotters were also male, which is consistent with previous Secret Service research on mass attacks."

So perhaps it's fitting that   are now fundamental to a presidential agenda. President Joe Biden is signaling that he's ready for the fight. But the issue is playing out in a particularly polarized way -- in entirely different directions at the federal level and inside states, depending on which party is in power -- that could easily jeopardize the rest of his agenda. Now that the president has called the   both ""un-American"" and ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century,"" there may be no avoiding what comes next. Even as Republicans debate new restrictions in Arizona, Florida, Texas and elsewhere, Democrats face pressure inside their own ranks to act boldly at the federal level in a much different direction. For now, Democrats see the GOP's   as racist attempts to buttress   lies told by former President Donald Trump. Republicans cast the   in Congress as self-serving and expensive attempts to federalize elections. When both parties say the other side is engaged in a ""power grab,"" it's hard to even think about middle ground. States are passing more restrictive voting-access measures without Democratic support and Biden and congressional leaders are backing more expansive measures without Republican support -- and may go so far as to blow up Senate rules to pass it. Biden, of course, needs a   to advance initiatives on immigration, gun control and virtually everything else on the agenda. He surely doesn't want the   to be "" .""  of Derek Chauvin  , bringing a renewed focus on police reform. Chauvin is the fired Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd. Chauvin was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd begged for his life. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, spurred by   in his memory, would establish a national standard for the operation of police departments, aims to streamline federal law to allow for the prosecution of excessive force, mandates that independent prosecutors handle police investigations, establishes data collection on police encounters and redirects funds to invest in transformative community-based policing programs. It would also ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, and would require that police only use deadly force as a last resort after trying de-escalation tactics. An identical bill passed the House in 2020 but languished in the Republican-led Senate. The legislation   220-212 without Republican support earlier this month and this time around Democrats have the majority. But the future is murky in the evenly divided Senate because a 60-vote requirement means that Democrats will need to entice 10 Republicans, many of whom are staunchly opposed. The   could also stamp out the attempt to address the outcry of thousands of protesters across the country who have called for transformative change in policing. Not even two months into his tenure as the head of the Michigan Republican Party, Ron Weiser is under fire. After calling three high-ranking female Democratic leaders in the state ""witches"" who should be ""ready for the burning at the stake,"" and mentioning ""assassination"" as a possible scenario to oust two Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach Trump, he issued an apology. ""In an increasingly vitriolic political environment, we should all do better to treat each other with respect, myself included. I fell short of that the other night. I apologize to those I offended for the flippant analogy about three women who are elected officials and for the off-hand comments about two other leaders,"" he said in a statement released Saturday. ""I have never advocated for violence and never will."" For the three women he targeted -- Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson -- Weiser went too far. And his attempt to walk back his controversial comments was seen as a ""half-apology"" that  , particularly in a state that has seen   directed at its elected officials over the last four years. For Whitmer, in particular, Weiser's rhetoric is ""destructive and downright dangerous,"" as a spokesperson for the governor put it. But it's also not the first time Republicans have put her in their crosshairs. As one of the most visible leaders during the coronavirus crisis, she was a favorite mark for Trump and, in turn, became a target of the right and of a thwarted kidnapping plot last year. As he confronts a set of concurrent challenges, President Joe Biden receives high marks on his top priorities -- the coronavirus pandemic and the economic recovery. Still, there are warning signs for other areas of his agenda where external events have imposed new urgency, a new   finds.

They  ; now, many are looking to him to return the favor. ""We've given him what he asked for, so now it is time for us to receive that in return,"" said Quati Woodberry-Gadson of North Charleston. ""Yes,   is an issue, but so is housing, so is health care, so are all of these things that we have been voting for and have been striving to achieve and accomplish."" Biden has surpassed two months in the White House and   returned to the state that helped reinvigorate his faltering 2020 campaign to hear directly from voters about where he is meeting expectations, where he may be missing the mark and their feelings about the direction of the country in the post-Donald Trump era. ""We're still worried about the variants and things like that, but for us it's the hope that we see in the vaccine rolling out,"" said Marybeth Berry, a university professor and mother of two from Columbia, who broadly praised Biden's handling of the pandemic. ""He came in with a plan,"" added retired Army Maj. Christopher Berry, a lifelong Republican, ""and he's letting the medical community -- more or less,   -- be the mouthpiece instead of him getting up in front of everybody trying to convince them what's real and what's not so."" Nationwide, voters of both parties have  of Biden's handling of the pandemic and plan to bolster the economy. But there are signs that many Americans -- including loyal Democrats -- harbor misgivings about the administration's early approach to immigration and gun violence. ""The crisis at the border is very concerning to me,"" said Marybeth Berry, a Democrat who voted for Biden. ""The kids in cages -- I was appalled at that during the Trump administration. ... And now to see it happening even more so with this influx of children at the border, that is concerning."" ""It's not a crisis,"" said Felisha Woodberry, a longtime Sen.   supporter in North Charleston, ""but I feel like they should have had a plan ready to go from day one to put in place for those people who were here and those who were coming."" Mayor Michael Butler of Orangeburg, a heavily African American community that is a must-visit on the road to the White House for Democrats, even volunteered that the southern border situation is a source of disappointment in the new president. ""I know we want to help everyone, but we still have to have standards for people to go through the immigration process,"" Butler said of the administration's approach to a surge in migrants from Central America. Biden won the Democratic primary in South Carolina with 48.6% of the vote, overwhelmingly defeating his next closest competitor, Sanders, who captured just 19.8%. The state's African American voters powered his victory with nearly two-thirds backing the former vice president. ""He's presidential. He's given us someone to look up to and say this is our leader, he and his family,"" said Butler, the first black mayor in Orangeburg history. He initially supported New York City Mayor   in the Democratic primary but now calls Biden a ""savior."" ""We needed someone to take us through the Red Sea and he's the one leading us across,"" he said. ""I would tell him, 'President Biden, continue doing what you're doing; build on principles and things that you've stood for; and make America become greater.'"" While many South Carolina Democrats praised Biden for his decency and measured tone, some told ABC News they are still waiting to see bold action that was promised during the campaign. ""We need to act -- not tomorrow, not a year from now, but today,"" said Lawrence Nathaniel, a once-homeless son of Columbia who founded   South Carolina   of George Floyd in May. ""Right now we're   on the Senate, and making sure that we can get the   passed through,"" Nathaniel said. ""We want the president and vice president to put a little more focus on it and not make it just a ceremonial thing."" Nathaniel, who supported businessman   in the primary, said he's cautiously optimistic Biden shares his urgency for change but is not convinced. ""There are people out here that are still hurting and that need help and need to be sure they can trust you as president of the United States,"" he said of his message to the president. Nina Grey, a 77-year-old retired minister and progressive activist, said she takes Biden at his word but that voters like her need to keep up pressure for action. ""You have to help him by expressing your point of view. I think everybody needs to do that, and we all need to find our citizenship voice and engage,"" Grey said in an interview at her Columbia home. ""I think he can deliver quite a bit."" At Biden's first campaign rally in South Carolina in 2019,   to end longtime support for a ban on federal funding for abortions and he agreed. Her exchange with the candidate, captured on cellphone video, was the first time Biden publicly changed his position on the issue. ""Of course his Catholic faith is against that, but I have also seen him evolve,"" Grey said. Marybeth Berry questioned Biden at a campaign event days before the primary vote in 2020 -- a town hall moment that went viral on social media -- asking the candidate to display more ""fire"" in his approach. Berry said that so far she's getting what she hoped for. ""You know there's always still a little politician stuff that, you know, you sort of wish wouldn't happen, but overall I think that he's -- he seems to be honest, and I mean he's getting things done,"" she said. In North Charleston, where the pandemic and recession have exacerbated financial and education inequality, Felisha Woodberry, an unemployment claims processor and mother of two, said she still  . ""I'm OK with what (Biden is) putting in place,"" Woodberry said. ""Bernie was the person that I felt like had a plan to hit the road. And I feel like with Joe Biden, what's happened more so is that everybody's so concerned with what's happening with COVID and what needs to happen with COVID that everything else is pushed back."" Her daughter, Quati Woodberry-Gadson, is spending her final weeks in college on an internship with local nonprofit  , which is bridging gaps in government support for families. ""Now that the pandemic has hit and is in full swing, it has really highlighted the necessity, as far as what kids are missing and lacking,"" said Woodberry-Gadson, who helps stockpile food, clothing and hygiene products for children at a local school. ""If there was some kind of way that (President Biden) could make it to South Carolina to actually see the disparities and the poverty rate and everything that's needed and necessary, I feel like it would be monumental to my community and to the people who I'm advocating for,"" she said. Biden has not yet returned to South Carolina as president, but has spent extensive time in the state during his career. In 2015, after a white supremacist   at a bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, then-Vice President Biden consoled the victims' families and worshipped with them out of the public spotlight. ""Faith that is not accompanied by action is dead,"" said  , who's wife Myra was among those killed in the church shooting. ""In Biden, faith is certainly not dead."" ""He just passed the   into law, and that's faith,"" Thompson added, ""because he's answering the needs of the people."" Thompson and his son, Anthony Thompson, Jr., said they were deeply moved by Biden's compassion after the massacre and are convinced he has the ability to bridge political divides. ""When we talk about criminal justice reform, you know, I think these are areas that are important to particularly the African American community,"" Thompson, Jr., said. ""And so for him coming out already for addressing those issues, I think that's very important and speaks to his leadership."" Days before the Thompsons spoke with ABC News, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a   that would strengthen gun-safety regulations and close the so-called Charleston background check loophole. The measure faces strong opposition from Republicans in the Senate. ""When they were checking   record, if they had just a lot more days, then my wife would still be here,"" the reverend said of the man who killed his wife with a gun obtained after a delay in his background check. ""One day it could be your family. Maybe your child, your wife, your best friend. You know, you just don't know how I feel, until it happens to you,"" he said. ""So why wait for it to happen to you or anybody close to you before you decide to do something about it."" As he reflected on divisions in American society and the challenges ahead in Biden's presidency, Thompson -- who has   his wife's killer -- said his prayer is that the idea of forgiveness will spread within our politics. ""People are trying to find a way to get peace from their burdens, and they just don't know how to do it, what to do. They think anger is going to be the thing to do it; revenge will be the thing to do it; but it never happens, just gets worse. That's what's happened to our country,"" Thompson said. ""We as people, as a nation, have to get past all the things that happened in the past, like slavery, like racism, discrimination, segregation. You got to begin in your family. Your family takes it, and it just spreads."""

But one of those calls will be particularly delicate because she'll be talking to a head of state who acts more like a narcotrafficker, U.S. prosecutors in New York have alleged. President Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras has been cast as a co-conspirator in a federal drug trafficking trial this month. His associate, now a convicted drug kingpin, has alleged that Hernandez accepted millions of dollars in bribes and helped protect a flood of cocaine into the U.S. Hernandez has not been charged and denied the allegations, even distorting State Department data about drug trafficking in his country to claim, ""HUGE SUCCESS!"" Many of the migrants reaching the southern U.S. border are fleeing violence, drugs and corruption in Honduras under Hernandez's watch. In light of the allegations against him, there is growing pressure on the Biden administration to change its approach to Hernandez, who claimed victory in a close 2017 re-election race that was marred by allegations of fraud -- but for which he received U.S. backing from the Trump administration. A State Department spokesperson told ABC News that the Biden administration is dedicated ""to fighting corruption in Honduras and we will support and work with leaders who are committed to these same goals."" But they would not say whether Hernandez is such a leader, criticize him directly or say if the administration sees him as part of the problem. Instead, they added their commitment ""to work with partner governments who are ready to make the needed political, rule-of-law and economic reforms that are essential to success."" President Joe Biden has pledged a $4 billion, multi-year investment project in Central America's so-called ""Northern Triangle"" -- Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The majority of migrants to the U.S. border are from one of these three countries, traversing through their larger neighbor Mexico and fleeing high rates of violence and gang activity, few jobs or opportunities, and much insecurity. The investment is in its earliest stages and has not yet been appropriated by Congress, but the Biden administration may move quickly with some funding as it faces a record increase of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. Harris will oversee an effort to not only stem the flow of migrants, according to the White House, but also establish a ""strategic partnership"" with Mexico and the Northern Triangle ""to enhance prosperity, combat corruption and strengthen the rule of law."" Given the allegations against him by U.S. prosecutors, some analysts say it is hard to see how Hernandez can be part of that. He has been repeatedly named in the trial of Honduran drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez this month. U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York alleged that he accepted bribes from Fuentes to facilitate tons of cocaine to the U.S. while a presidential candidate and leader of Honduras' congress in 2013. While appearing to cooperate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Hernandez reportedly vowed to tear up Honduras' extradition treaty with the U.S. and ""stuff drugs up the gringos' noses,"" prosecutors said. In addition to Fuentes, Hernandez's brother Tony Hernandez, also a Honduran congressman, was convicted in October 2019 of drug trafficking charges and lying to the Drug Enforcement Agency. He is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday for up to life in prison. While the State Department declined to directly criticize Hernandez, it said none of Biden's $4 billion investment will go directly to governments in the region, including Hernandez's, but to civil society, religious organizations, international organizations and nongovernmental organizations. ""This is not a blank check,"" the department spokesperson added. ""Addressing the region's daunting challenges requires systemic change and political will from the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Combating corruption and impunity is at the center of our strategy for the region. Central America will never live up to its full potential without addressing endemic corruption."" But they would not say how they'll do that, especially with Hernandez in power -- except that they have ""robust"" ways to monitor how funds are spent and they ""will use all available tools, including visa restrictions, to promote accountability for corrupt actors."" Whether that extends to a head of government remains to be seen. While U.S. prosecutors have directly implicated Hernandez, charging him would be a highly unusual move to make against a foreign head of government. Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro was charged in March 2020 by the Justice Department for drug trafficking too, but the Trump administration no longer recognized him as Venezuelan president. Hernandez also said earlier this month that State Department data provides an ""instant rebuttal of the false narrative"" against him -- tweeting that his ""government dramatically lowered the drug rate from 87% to 4%... a reduction of 95.4%"" But that distorts data from the State Department's annual reports on international narcotics control. In 2013, it said that up to ""87 percent of all cocaine smuggling flights departing south America first land in Honduras,"" a key transit point for narcotrafficking because of how remote and ungoverned its north coast is. In the 2020 report, that number drop to 4%, but largely because ""more is assessed to have transited through Honduras by land after making a first arrival in other countries."" The State Department declined to comment on Hernandez's claim, but its 2020 narcotics report highlights cooperation with the Honduran government despite the prosecutors' allegations. ""The political will of the Honduran government to combat drug trafficking in coordination with U.S. law enforcement agencies continues,"" the report said. ""The Government of Honduras does not, as a matter of official government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs."" The problem runs much deeper than Hernandez, too. Yani Rosenthal, the front-runner to be one of the two major party's presidential nominee, was released from U.S. prison in August after serving three years for money laundering, while several other candidates in the country's primaries earlier this month were under investigation for corruption. Critically, one of the reasons Hernandez remains in power now is because of prior U.S. backing. After removing the country's limit of two presidential terms, Hernandez claimed victory in 2017 in a narrow contest that international election observers from the Organization of American States and the European Union said was fraudulent. The Trump administration, however, stood by Hernandez in the face of widespread protests and a bloody government response that left dozens dead. The State Department said there were ""irregularities identified by the OAS and the EU,"" but called for ""robust national dialogue ... to heal the political divide"" and congratulated Hernandez. Lawmakers back then opposed Trump's support for Hernandez, and this week, a group of Democrats have stepped forward to urge Biden to reconsider the U.S. partnership with Hernandez. Rep. Norma Torres, a leading U.S. lawmaker on Central American issues and a Guatemalan native, wrote to Biden's team this week to stop ""sending money to directly to the hands of corrupt officials"" like Hernandez. Last month, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., introduced a bill to impose sanctions on Hernandez and suspend U.S. security assistance and export licenses for certain defense-related items to the country."

""I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,"" Walensky said at a White House briefing. ""We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now, I'm scared."" Walensky has   that the country would face another, avoidable surge in COVID-19 cases if Americans didn't keep wearing masks, avoid travel, and continue social distancing until more of the population is vaccinated. Not long after, Biden echoed her warning. ""I'm reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate – please,"" Biden said at an event announcing more vaccine eligibility. ""This is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And businesses should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously -- precisely what got us in this mess in the first place -- risks more cases and more desks -- deaths."" ""We're in the life-and-death race for the virus that is spreading quickly, with cases rising again, new variants are spreading,” he said. “And, sadly, some of the reckless behavior we have seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead."" He said he thought some states should pause their reopening efforts. Walensky said the CDC is now seeing the number of new COVID-19 cases and people hospitalized with the disease increase, which she attributed to increased travel in recent weeks, lifting restrictions, and more relaxed behavior. The seven-day average of cases is slightly below 60,000 cases a day, a 10% increase over the previous period. Hospitalizations and deaths also have increased. Walensky said the CDC is investigating outbreaks at a local level in individual states. The largest increases have occurred in Michigan, Connecticut, North Dakota, New York, Iowa and Vermont. ""I think we are seeing that many of these states are opening up at levels that we wouldn't necessarily recommend. I am working with the governors. I will be speaking with them tomorrow to try and buckle down on trying to refrain from opening up too fast,"" she said. Walensky reflected on her experience treating COVID-19 patients over the last year, saying she has been the last person to sit with someone's loved one when they were dying and knows the stress on healthcare providers not sure if they'll have the resources to treat every patient. And she said with the vaccination effort underway the end of the pandemic is within reach, but she said until more Americans are vaccinated everyone has to continue wearing masks, refrain from nonessential travel, and take steps to prevent more people from becoming sick. She warned another COVID-19 surge along the lines of last summer or the winter would slow down efforts to vaccinate more people. ""We have come such a long way. Three historic scientific breakthrough  , and we are rolling them out so very fast. So I'm speaking today not necessarily as your CDC director or not only as your CDC director, but as a wife, as a mother, as a daughter, to ask you to just please hold on for a little while longer,"" she said. ""I so badly want to be done, I know you all so badly want to be done, we're just almost there, but not quite yet. And so I'm asking you to just hold on a little longer to get vaccinated when you can, so that all of those people that we all love was still be here when this pandemic ends,"" she said."

In fact, the email accounts of top officials at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency -- the very DHS agency charged with fighting cyber threats -- may have been compromised by the cyberattack, according to one former government official familiar with the matter. In a statement, DHS acknowledges a ""small number"" of employees accounts were targeted in the breach, but there are no indicators that their networks are compromised as of now. ""A widespread intrusion campaign targeted many federal government and private sector entities, including DHS,"" according to a DHS spokesperson. ""Upon learning about the campaign, the Department took immediate steps to respond to the incident, including leveraging response teams from CISA and private sector partners, to continue executing its mission,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, this widespread intrusion campaign has again shown that our strategic adversaries are sophisticated, persistent, and have increasing capabilities.” The massive hack, discovered in December, affected nine federal agencies, according to Deputy National Security Adviser for cyber Anne Neuberger. Those responsible were ""likely of Russian origin,"" that the hack was ""launched from inside the United States” and that it could take ""several months"" to complete the investigation, she said at a press briefing in February. The administration has yet to outline what exactly their response will be to the hack. FBI Director Chris Wray, asked earlier this month by Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., what the U.S. government's response should be to the SolarWinds hack, said he didn't want to answer specifically because ""discussing the response in any detail is probably something that would be better done in a classified setting. That by itself might give you a little bit of a hint."" Wray said more generally that coming back from the SolarWinds hack would be a ""long, hard slog,"" even using the strategy that has been most effective for the U.S. in the past regarding countering cyber adversaries."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-swipes-trump-administration-unveiling-human-rights-report/story?id=76770342,politics,Blinken swipes at Trump administration in unveiling human rights report,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken repudiated the Trump administration's approach to human rights, with his most direct condemnation of his predecessor yet. Blinken launched the department's 45th annual human rights report Tuesday -- the gold standard in documenting abuses and atrocities in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. The report, which covers 2020, found a further deterioration for human rights in many countries, particularly as governments used the   pandemic to curb their citizens' rights. The first report under the Biden administration also   that eliminated   of the Trump years, like ending former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's ""hierarchy"" of rights and re-introducing a section on women's reproductive rights that will be published later this year. When human rights defenders ""come under attack, they often look to the United States to speak up on their behalf. Too often in recent years, these defenders heard only silence from us,"" Blinken said. ""We are back for those brave advocates as well. We will not be silent."" In particular, Blinken ""decisively"" repudiated Pompeo's ""Unalienable Rights Commission,"" a panel of academics that said in a report last July that freedom of religion and right to property were the most important human rights. While Pompeo touted the report and said it would lay a foundation for future administrations, critics accused it of minimizing minority rights. Blinken essentially jettisoned the report, saying Tuesday, ""There is no hierarchy that makes some rights more important than others. Past unbalanced statements that suggest such a hierarchy, including those offered by a recently disbanded State Department advisory committee, do not represent a guiding document for this administration."" Human rights are increasingly under threat around the world, Blinken said, saying the trendlines ""are in the wrong direction."" In particular, he highlighted what he called the Chinese   of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province, attacks on civil society and   in Russia, Uganda and Venezuela and on pro-democracy protesters in Belarus,   in Yemen, atrocities ""credibly reported"" in Ethiopia's Tigray region, and abuses by the Syria's Bashar al-Assad's regime. While the report doesn't touch on Myanmar's coup and the military's bloody  , because they happened in 2021, Blinken took time to again condemn the events. But after weeks of steadily increasing U.S. sanctions that have not deterred the ruling junta, he had no specific answer on what else the U.S. could do to change the darkening trajectory there. Blinken also leaned into America's own human rights issues, particularly the moment of racial reckoning in the last year. Chinese officials and state-run outlets   U.S. race relations to say American officials are in no position to criticize Beijing -- comparing Uighur slave labor in Xinjiang to Black slaves in the U.S. South. ""We know we have work to do at home. That includes addressing profound inequities, including systemic racism. We don't pretend these problems don't exist. ... We deal with them in the daylight with full transparency, and in fact, that's exactly what separates our democracy and autocracies,"" he said, adding that open reckoning gives the U.S. ""greater legitimacy"" to address other countries' records, too. The Biden administration will use all tools available to impose consequences on human rights abusers and encourage better behavior, Blinken said,   Khashoggi policy that imposes visa restrictions on officials that target or harass their countries' dissidents. ""Standing up for human rights everywhere is in America's interests, and the Biden-Harris administration will stand against human rights abuses wherever they occur, regardless of whether the perpetrators are adversaries or partners,"" he said."
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-taps-11-judicial-nominees-historic-diversity/story?id=76768724,politics,Biden taps 11 judicial nominees with historic diversity,"President Joe Biden announced Tuesday the nomination of a diverse group of eleven judicial nominees, several of whom he said would make history if confirmed to the bench. “This trailblazing slate of nominees draws from the very best and brightest minds of the American legal profession. Each is deeply qualified and prepared to deliver justice faithfully under our Constitution and impartially to the American people — and together they represent the broad diversity of background, experience, and perspective that makes our nation strong,” Biden said in a statement. One notable choice is U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to take the place of Attorney General Merrick Garland on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The pick signals that Jackson could be a contender to be the first African American woman to nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was one of Biden's campaign pledges. Jackson was nominated to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama in 2012. She attended Harvard Law School and has clerked for prominent judges, including Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Early in her career, Jackson served as a public defender in the District of Columbia, career experience some supporters have praised. If confirmed, Biden's nominees also include the first Muslim American to become a federal judge in U.S. history, the first Asian-American woman to serve on the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., and the first woman of color to serve as a federal judge for the District of Maryland, according to the White House press release. Shortly after the president unveiled his nominees, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer released a statement saying that the Senate will work ""quickly to confirm"" them. ""America is so much better when our rich diversity is reflected in every aspect of society, especially our justice system,"" Schumer said.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/1st-news-media-allowed-inside-overcrowded-migrant-facility/story?id=76768789,politics,1st news media allowed inside overcrowded migrant facility under Biden ,"The Biden administration for the first time on Tuesday allowed news media inside a Customs and Border Protection facility facing unprecedented overcrowding due to the recent surge of migrant children and families. A growing backlog inflamed by the coronavirus pandemic has caused delays for the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency responsible for housing children after they are apprehended by Border Patrol. Representatives from the press were allowed inside a temporary tent facility in Donna, Texas, which was meant to hold 250 migrants but had a population of more than 4,100 as of Tuesday. Of those, 3,400 were unaccompanied minors and more than 2,000 have waited beyond the legal limit of 72 hours, according to Customs and Border Protection. The video shows children and families packed into tight living quarters, sleeping on gray camping mats with mylar blankets for warmth. In transparent, plastic pods there is hardly room to walk with young children crammed shoulder to shoulder. Journalists also saw a fenced in recreation area where two groups of boys were playing soccer, agents in dark sunglasses watching over them. The facility spans 184,000 square feet and requires a staff of more than 500 agents. It takes $16 million per month to run the facility. ""As I have said repeatedly, a Border Patrol facility is no place for a child,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement Tuesday. ""We have been working around the clock, in coordination with HHS, to quickly move unaccompanied children out of these crowded Border Patrol stations and into the care of HHS so they can be placed with family members or other sponsors."" Earlier Tuesday morning, U.S. Border Patrol took a small group of journalists along dirt roads near the borderline, where they observed the arrest of migrants who had surrendered to authorities prior to their likely transfer to the Donna processing center. All unaccompanied children who are apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley are brought to the Donna facility where they receive a health screening and wait to be transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. CBP also takes temperatures as they arrive and refers them to additional health checks if they have a fever. Acting Executive Officer for Rio Grande Valley Operational Programs Division Oscar Escamilla showed reporters through the facility on Tuesday. ""Yes we are officers. Yes we enforce the   laws,"" Escamilla said. ""But when you have kids involved, we have to take care of these kids. This is not the right place for these kids."" Escamilla said children are offered the opportunity to call family members at least once every 48 hours while they are in the facility. The new administration took swift actions right from the start to reverse several immigration policies of the Trump era. While the new White House has come under fire for pulling back hard-line restrictions before it was fully prepared to handle the current surge of migrants, some remain in place. Biden administration officials are quick to point out one major departure from Trump’s pandemic-era immigration restrictions: the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children. When the Trump administration invoked a section of the public health code known as ""Title 42"" it gave immigration authorities the green light to start rapidly removing unaccompanied migrant children. Mostly in their teens, kids at the time were sent back to Mexico sometimes within a matter of hours. Customs and Border Protection said it was necessary to reduce overcrowding at its facilities. Legal advocates for immigrants have decried the use of Title 42 as illegal and unnecessarily cruel. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has taken on the responsibility of processing and caring for children who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian. The change, combined with an unprecedented increase in the number of kids found crossing the border, has strained government resources and sent the Biden administration scrambling to find more shelter space. Federal officials have enlisted convention centers in California and Texas, and even co-opted a NASA site for the mass housing effort. The difference in the application of the Title 42 so-called health mandates is also seen with migrant families who cross the border. Thousands have been turned back or ""expelled"" under the Biden administration, but the majority in recent weeks have remained in the U.S. for traditional immigration processing. Last February, nearly 20,000 migrant families were stopped at the border by U.S. immigration authorities. Of those, nearly 8,000 were rapidly ""expelled"" under Title 42. U.S. officials have said immigration officials on the other side of the border, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, have refused to accept families with children under the age of 7."

And it appears to be working. But the   by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as echoed by President Joe Biden, are reminders of the precarious nature of this moment regarding  . The Biden White House is now battling complacency in addition to politics, and   any sense that the pandemic is over. ""The war against COVID-19 is far from won,"" Biden said Monday, in encouraging governors to keep or reinstate mask mandates and announcing a strategic change in federal vaccination programs. ""As much as we're doing, America, it's time to do even more."" Polls have consistently   in Biden's leadership on COVID and vaccine distribution. But they have also shown partisan splits in willingness to follow   officials' recommendations, as Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell hinted at Monday in specifically encouraging ""Republican men"" to get vaccinated. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization is formally releasing its investigation into the origins of the pandemic. With former Trump administration officials making news with candid assessments about how the early months were handled, it might feel like a moment to look back instead of look forward. Five days ago, Biden stood for more than   and   about COVID. You can blame a relentless news cycle, or reporters for not asking about it, or even take that as a good sign about the country's mood at the moment. Biden would love to talk about other priorities, including the   he is set to outline Wednesday. But he needs to keep talking about the pandemic, as he and his aides are quite aware. Overnight, the seven-week-long voting period at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, came to a close. But in what has become   throughout pandemic-era elections, the results of this count won't be known for at least another week as more than 5,800   face the prospects of creating the first union at an   in the United States. The tabulation delay is likely to stem from challenges over factors like improper job classification or ineligibility due to employment dates. Both Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union -- the group from which Bessemer facility workers in favor of unionizing are   -- can raise these concerns before the vote tally is finalized. Beyond Alabama, the Bessemer warehouse election has already put labor law reform on the political map by giving common ground to the White House and party progressives. Biden   with a supportive video   last month, in which he reiterated his administration's policy of supporting union organization and collective bargaining. Meanwhile, high-profile progressives mobilized to highlight the impact of the pandemic on the working conditions of the predominantly Black workers at the Bessemer facility, which culminated in a Friday visit from Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of the most vocal political   of Amazon's attempts to block unionization. ""This campaign has already been a victory in many ways. Even though we don't know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country,"" Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU said in a statement. After a censure by the state GOP and a vow to unseat her, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is facing her first potential   in Kelly Tshibaka. Alaska's all-party primary and ranked-choice general election means that Tshibaka won't face Murkowski directly in a primary, but her campaign launch made clear who she is running against, calling out Murkowski for her decision to vote with ""D.C. insiders."" Murkowski crossed party lines in February when she   former President Donald Trump with incitement of insurrection. Trump unleashed his ire on Murkowski the same way he did with   who   or convict him by   to those who   until the very end. Tshibaka makes no mention of Trump in her campaign launch, something unique as Trump allies have been jumping into high-profile congressional races across the country, but she did appear to side with him on the issue of election integrity by espousing a number of false theories about fraud in the November election. Trump hasn't weighed in on the   aside from a promise to unseat Murkowski, but it appears Tshibaka will have the backing of top Trump advisers:   reported Monday afternoon that former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, along with a number of other Trump alums, will serve as advisers to her campaign. After early primary defeats in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Joe Biden staked his bid for the presidency on the voters of South Carolina. They delivered for him; now, many are looking to him to return the favor. Biden has surpassed two months in the White House and   returned to the state that helped reinvigorate his faltering 2020 campaign to   about where he is meeting expectations, where he may be missing the mark and their feelings about the direction of the country in the post-Donald Trump era.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-matt-gaetz-denies-sexual-relationship-underage-girl/story?id=76780776,politics,Rep. Matt Gaetz denies sexual relationship with underage girl amid reports of DOJ investigation,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Tuesday denied that he had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl amid new reports that the Justice Department was investigating the alleged relationship -- claiming the probe was part of an elaborate extortion scheme. The investigation, first reported by The New York Times, began last summer and focuses on whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with an underage girl and paid for her to travel with him, and whether he violated federal sex trafficking laws, a source aware of the investigation confirmed to ABC News. Gaetz told the Times that his lawyers were informed that he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview Tuesday night. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" The New York Times reported that the inquiry into Gaetz is part of a larger inquiry into Joel Greenberg, a former Florida official indicted last summer on charges that included sex trafficking of a child and financially supporting people in exchange for sex. Greenberg has pleaded not guilty. On Fox News, Gaetz -- who, according to an Axios report earlier on Tuesday, had been telling confidants he was considering retiring from Congress and possibly joining the right-wing media outlet Newsmax -- appeared to confirm the investigation when he said he was approached by someone who claimed he could ""make this investigation go away."" ""There was a demand for money in exchange for a commitment that he could make this investigation go away along with his co-conspirators,"" Gaetz said, identifying the alleged extortionist as former DOJ official David McGee. McGee did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. In an interview with the Washington Post, McGee denied Gaetz's claim that he was part of an extortion effort targeting the Florida congressman. ""It is completely false. It's a blatant attempt to distract from the fact that he's under investigation for sex trafficking of minors,"" McGee told the Post. ""I have no connection with that case at all, other than, one of a thousand people who have heard the rumors."" ""I do believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to smear me,"" Gaetz said on Fox News. In a statement from his office, Gaetz said he had been cooperating with authorities and that his father ""has even been wearing a wire"" at the FBI's direction ""to catch these criminals"" seeking to extort him for $25 million. Asked in the Fox News interview how long the investigation had been going on, Gaetz said ""I don't know,"" and went on to suggest that someone is alleging there are ""pictures of me with child prostitutes,"" which he claimed was ""obviously false."" At one point during the interview, Gaetz claimed that two years ago he had dinner with Carlson and took along  a ""friend"" who was ""actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn't cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme that she could face trouble."" But Carlson promptly denied knowing what Gaetz was talking about, responding: ""I don't remember the woman you're speaking of or the context at all, honestly."" After returning from a commercial break, Carlson called the segment ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted."""
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/civil-rights-group-sue-georgia-voting-law/story?id=76775186,politics,Civil rights groups sue Georgia over new voting law,"Civil rights groups on Tuesday said they have sued the state of Georgia over   enacted last week that they said   for all Georgia  , particularly people of color.

The groups are suing in federal court on behalf of a church and other community groups. ""The elections were celebrated not just for their turnout, but also for their integrity, with Georgia officials praising them as safe and secure,"" the release said. ""But rather than act to expand participation in the political process, Georgia leaders responded by doing what they have done many times in the state's history: they placed burdensome, unjustified, and unnecessary restrictions on voters, particularly voters of color and other historically disenfranchised communities."" Sophia Lakin, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, pinned the motives of the law on race. ""This law is driven by blatant racism, represents politics at its very worst, and is clearly illegal,"" Lakin said in the statement. ""We urge the court to act swiftly to strike it down."" Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defended the law from criticism last week, saying that critics -- including President Joe Biden -- hadn't read the law. ""This bill expands voting access, streamlines vote-counting procedures, and ensures election integrity,"" Kemp said in a tweeted statement. There is nothing 'Jim Crow' about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot -- every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person."" Biden   an ""atrocity"" when speaking to reporters last week. In a statement Friday, he likened it to ""Jim Crow"" laws and called on Congress to pass a Democratic-supported federal measure to protect voting rights. ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the   Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Prominent Georgia voting rights activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams released a statement about the law shortly after it was passed last week. ""Every business, political, and civic leader must stand up and make their opposition to these desperate anti-democratic laws clear,"" Abrams said. ""At a time when Georgia ranks as the worst state for COVID vaccination rates, Georgia Republicans instead are singularly focused on reviving Georgia's dark past of racist voting laws."""

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/states-open-eligibility-1st-big-test-americas-vaccine/story?id=76768464,politics,"As states open up eligibility, the 1st big test of America's vaccine hesitancy","As the majority of adults in the country now sit on the cusp of eligibility for the    , the U.S. is shifting into the first real-world test of   of the inoculations. Up until the last few weeks,   only Americans with the highest   from the virus and the biggest incentive to protect themselves, were eligible. But by late April, as vaccine supply ramps up, all adults -- not just those with the most reason to fear the virus --   and get their shot. So, will they? ""This is when the real work begins,"" said Dr. Timothy Callaghan, a   politics professor at Texas A&M University who studies vaccine hesitancy. Callaghan said public health experts have been   particular fight for months, even before earlier vaccine issues were smoothed over. ""We weren't worried about the supply issues that we were seeing early in the vaccine delivery process,"" Callaghan said. ""We were concerned about what was going to start to happen from April through July, as states start to realize we have the vaccines, but don't have people to take them."" Now, on the heels of President Joe Biden's announcement that   to all adults by April 19, the time has come. The U.S. is administering nearly 3 million shots per day and, by May, drugmakers are expected to deliver enough vaccines to vaccinate 300 million Americans. Meanwhile, about six in 10 Americans reported already getting a vaccine or intending to get one -- a number that has increased -- with 17% who said they're taking a ""wait and see"" approach, according to March polling from the  . Remaining about the same since December are the 13% who said they will ""definitely not"" get the vaccine. With the floodgates open to mass vaccination, the spring and summer months should provide a clearer view of how much work needs to be done to vaccinate as many Americans as possible, Callaghan said. Among the first states to widen eligibility were Alaska, Mississippi, Texas, West Virginia, Ohio and Utah. As of Thursday, 19 states total had opened their eligibility to all adults 16 and older, and another 27 states plus Washington, D.C., had announced plans to do so. Some rural and Republican states have already seen signs of early hesitancy that allowed them, in part, to open their vaccination rollout up to the broader population earlier than any other states. Polling has shown people living in red, rural states report more vaccine hesitancy. In Ohio, the governor said they've seen less interest in vaccine registration as they open it up to younger populations. ""We seem to be having a slower uptake every time we move down in age,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said at a press briefing just before the state opened eligibility to all adults on March 29. ""But, I mean, the interesting thing is even in the older groups, you continue still to see those numbers go up,"" he said, noting that the number of vaccinated people in their 80s is continuing to rise. DeWine openly acknowledged that he was concerned about vaccine hesitancy getting in the way of herd immunity for the state, though. ""Frankly, a lot is gonna depend on our young people's willingness to take this vaccine and to slow the spread down,"" DeWine said. And in West Virginia, the state's   response coordinator, Clay Marsh, said they were surprised that as many people are getting vaccinated as they are. The state widely opened eligibility on March 22. ""We did anticipate having a lot more vaccine hesitancy,"" Marsh said, noting that people from rural and Republican areas of the country are more hesitant than those from urban and Democrat areas. ""Well, we're pretty rural and we're pretty Republican,"" Marsh continued. And while they've seen pockets of hesitancy, Marsh said, the state has been pleased that 70% of people in the 65+ age group have gotten vaccines. In December, state data showed that around 45% of the state was either less willing or strongly unwilling to get a vaccine. In Mississippi, one local doctor suggested people are waiting for the vaccine to appear at their physician's office before they get the shot. The state opened up eligibility to all adults two weeks ago and continues to have thousands of open appointments. ""It's not so much hesitancy as it is access for most of our patients,"" said Dr. Laura Miller, a family physician who mostly treats patients from rural, minority communities in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi. Because   of all the vaccines in Mississippi have been offered at drive-thru mass vaccination clinics and other state-run sites, Miller sees a lot of patients who want to or need to wait until they can get the vaccine closer to home, in a more familiar setting. ""I have patients here that want to get their shot, they just don't have a means to get there or don't want to until I can do it,"" Miller said. There's also ""some hesitancy, and there's some straight refusal,"" she added. Still, Miller predicted that when there's enough vaccine supply to get doses out to individual clinics and pharmacies, ""we'll have some fairly steady uptake."" On Monday, Biden said that by April 19, 90% of Americans will live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Taken all together, even among states that share population demographics and politics, there's still not a sole factor that can predict vaccine hesitancy. Jeff Zients, Biden's coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters at a briefing last week that he wasn't concerned about states that were opening their eligibility up to all adults well in advance of the May 1 deadline. ""If there are states that are lagging behind, we're working with those states to ensure that they continue to prioritize the most vulnerable populations. That said, with the increase in demand, we think it's a good thing that states are opening up eligibility to all Americans no later than May 1st,"" Zients said Friday. But while there will be people who want the vaccine and people who don't, states will also have to do more than just open up eligibility to achieve herd immunity. They will have to improve systems making it harder for people to get the vaccine, compounding hesitancy that already exists. Long drives to unfamiliar towns or cities where vaccines are being distributed, clunky registration websites, long hold times on the phone and lack of outreach can all give the impression of ""vaccine hesitancy,"" when in reality, community members are willing to get the vaccine but face logistical hurdles, which are often worse in poorer communities. Experts have also warned that opening up eligibility widely could allow people with easier access to transportation and technology to leap over less advantaged people for appointments. ""That is a potential red flag and something to be aware of,"" Callaghan said. ""To try and work against that, states need to be paying attention to populations they are vaccinating on a daily and weekly basis to say 'okay, we're not getting enough people from this at-risk community or that at-risk community, so maybe we need to set aside some appointments for those groups to make sure that they are still getting vaccinated.'"" There will also be unpredictable benefits to widely opening up eligibility, like the power of peer pressure. As more people get the vaccine, they'll share how they got it and what it felt like with their friends and family, increasing trust in the shot. But for the next several weeks, the effect will be unknown. ""You can't really say that hesitancy is the cause until you've given people a chance to vaccinate and then they choose not to,"" Callaghan said."

Known as IVAS, the acronym for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, the goggles project 3D terrain maps over what soldiers see directly in front of them and allows troops to see in the dark, through smoke and even around corners. Based on Microsoft's HoloLens 2, the augmented reality goggles were ruggedized for the wear and tear of combat and have undergone prototype testing over the past two years. On Wednesday, the Army announced that it had awarded a 10-year production contract to Microsoft for the IVAS system potentially worth $21.88 billion. The contract has a five-year base period followed by another five-year option, said Courtney Bacon, an Army spokesperson. Microsoft said that the contract could provide more than 120,000 goggles to the Close Combat Force. ""We appreciate the partnership with the U.S. Army, and are thankful for their continued trust in transitioning IVAS from rapid prototyping to rapid fielding,"" wrote Microsoft's Alex Kipman in a   post. Kipman designed Holo Lens and has led the research and development of the goggle's conversion into IVAS for the Army. Last fall, Kipman told ABC News that the goggle system provides soldiers with a significant upgrade in situational awareness. The system gives soldiers more information than they have ever had on the battlefield. ""The IVAS aggregates multiple technologies into an architecture that allows the Soldier to Fight, Rehearse, and Train using a single platform,"" said an Army statement   the production contract. Attached to combat helmets, the clear goggles allow soldiers to know precisely where they are thanks to a heads-up display, or HUD, that provides them with an overhead compass and overlays maps of their location. Holograms and 3D terrain maps are projected onto the goggles to see what lies ahead and lets soldiers know precisely where their squad mates are on the battlefield. The goggles also incorporate significant improvements in night vision and thermal imagery technologies that give soldiers a full 180-degree field of view. An attachment mounted on a rifle barrel projects onto the HUD whatever could be seen through the rifle scope, regardless of what direction a soldier is looking. That capability gives troops an edge in dangerous urban warfare by letting them peer around corners. The high-tech goggles will be made available to all of the Army's combat infantry troops, bringing them resources that may have once been only available to elite units. Eric Oehlerich, a retired Navy SEAL and ABC News contributor, sees that as a step toward improving the combat effectiveness of all American troops on the battlefield. ""The more situational awareness you have about your forces, and the enemy position, the easier it is to dominate the fight,"" he added. ""Investments in equipment like the IVAS goggles will greatly increase the awareness each service member will have during the 'fog of war,' making them more lethal when called upon."" Mick Mulroy, a retired Marine and ABC News contributor, agreed with Oehlerich, but also stressed that basic military skills will need to be maintained. ""It is also important that we don't become over reliant on technology,"" said Mulroy. ""We need to train with it and without it, as our adversaries will no doubt try and counter our technological improvements."" The deal is the second major contract won by the tech giant in recent years. Last year, the Pentagon selected Microsoft over Amazon to take over its $10 billion JEDI cloud project. While the IVAS contract is twice as large as the JEDI project, it could end up being less if the Army decides not to pursue its five-year option."

The policy, which goes into effect July 1, grants students an excused absence from school one day a year to ""engage in a civic or political event."" School districts in other states have passed similar policies, but Virginia is the first to pass one statewide.

""But it's also about just getting a sense of what your government is and trying to make a difference -- meeting with legislators, attending protests -- it's much more."" Savage decided to lobby his representatives to take the 2019 Fairfax County initiative statewide after seeing another policy his school district piloted -- requiring free menstrual products in schools -- had passed the Virginia legislature. He strategized with other Young Democrats and began reaching out to lawmakers, including Democrats Del. Sam Rasoul and state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, who committed to introducing it. ""It's critically important for us not to just encourage the youth to vote, but to actually empower them and have them involved in the civic process and what better way than to have them help draft bills -- which is what happened here -- help them lobby and then help them actually pass these bills,"" Rasoul said. McClellan said she chose to sponsor the legislation to stoke the students' interests. ""There is no substitute for live action, and by participating in civic events, they come alive in a way they just can't in a book or in a lecture in the classroom, so it will spark a passion in them that hopefully will keep them engaged,"" McClellan said. Savage also reached out to his Republican counterparts who agreed to collaborate on the bill. ""I don't think that this bill is liberal or conservative, I think it just helps students, it helps teenagers across the commonwealth get more involved, and that's something we all need to be working towards,"" said Teenage Republican Federation of Virginia Chairman Brady Hillis, 17. Republican Del. Glenn Davis decided to co-sponsor the legislation after the GOP students reached out to him. ""In a time that is so partisan in our nation right now, to see teenage Republicans and teenage Democrats come together to work together on a bill … sometimes you have to look at the next generation to see really how the adults should be acting,"" Davis said. Not every Republican in the Virginia General Assembly was so moved. ""I'm all for educating and getting more people involved in civics but school and education is a lot more important,"" said Republican Del. Wendell Walker. Republican Del. John Avoli said he encourages student engagement in civics but believes local school boards should be making these decisions. Mia Tilman, now an 18-year-old freshman at the College William and Mary, used the Fairfax County policy when she was a high school senior to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment in Washington. She said she is not sure she would have done so if her absence was unexcused because she was concerned about blemishing her record while she was applying to colleges. Student athletes and students involved in academic clubs are excused from school for sports games and academic conferences, but there was no equivalent for a student interested in politics and civic action, Tilman said. ""To me, protesting is my academics, it is what I want to do with the rest of my life, and it holds just as much value to me as someone going to an athletic tournament to pursue their career,"" Tilman said. High school junior Makenzie Hymes, 16, also used the Fairfax policy to lobby for the ERA. ""There's so much you can learn outside of the classroom,"" Hymes said of her visit to the U.S. Capitol. ""(In) that type of environment, the littlest thing is like a whole life lesson."" Savage used the Fairfax County policy in order skip class and testify on the bill virtually before the state's House Education Committee. Gov. Ralph Northam signed the bill into law on March 12. Savage said students from both parties in other states have begun reaching out to him, saying they are trying to work with their legislators to introduce a similar bill in their state. ""Virginia has taken a national leadership role and is a goldfish bowl for the rest of the country in terms of civic engagement now,"" Savage said."
